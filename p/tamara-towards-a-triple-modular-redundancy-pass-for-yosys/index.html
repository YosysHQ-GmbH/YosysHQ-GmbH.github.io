    Foreword
</h2><p>Although I&rsquo;m a computer scientist by education, I&rsquo;ve always been interested in space since I was a kid. For a
long time, I had simply forgotten about this interest, as I got more in-depth into FPGAs, then ASICs, and
eventually EDA. I had no idea that eventually, an incredible opportunity would come to combine these two
together, thanks to Yosys!</p>
<p>In late 2023, I pitched a research project to my academic supervisor at the University of Queensland in
Australia. Here, we have a degree &ldquo;Bachelor of Computer Science (Honours)&rdquo; that is somewhat similar to a
Master&rsquo;s degree as it involves a one-year research thesis. At the time, I had simply pitched the design and
implementation of a simple RISC-V microcontroller. As my supervisor pointed out, this is a fun project, but
has little to no research potential.</p>
<p>As we brainstormed ways to improve the project, I recalled hearing about a <em>Super Mario 64</em> speedrun that was
allegedly disrupted by a random bit flip caused by a stray cosmic ray. As I did more serious research into
this topic, I found a very interesting research field with all sorts of interesting trade-offs, on top of the
ones you get in normal FPGA/ASIC design.</p>
<p>I quickly realised that far more than just designing <em>one</em> fault-tolerant processor, it could be possible to
design a generalised EDA flow that could make <em>any</em> processor fault-tolerant.</p>
<p>Thankfully, I was already familiar with Yosys. In Australia, unlike Europe and the US, we do not currently
have a very large or well-resourced domestic FPGA/ASIC research community. This means that, as university
students and researchers, we don&rsquo;t often (or ever) have access to industry tools like Cadence and
Synopsys, so I had started my FPGA work using purely open-source tools. This, in fact, turns out to be a
blessing in disguise. I&rsquo;m passionate about FOSS tools, and Yosys - being open-source - allows you to peel back
the hood and deeply understand <em>how</em> it does certain synthesis passes, which allows for really deep learning,
plus the opportunity to improve the tool yourself. Very importantly, it also means that custom passes can
easily be added, which is not at all possible with restrictive commercial tools. This makes it a very
important tool in academia, and indeed, Yosys is coming up in more and more publications.</p>
<p>The project I ended up pitching, and had approved, was titled, &ldquo;An Automated Triple Modular Redundancy EDA
Flow for Yosys&rdquo;.</p>
<h2 id="background---what-is-triple-modular-redundancy">
    <a href="#background---what-is-triple-modular-redundancy" class="header-anchor">#</a>
    Background - What is Triple Modular Redundancy?
</h2><p>For safety-critical sectors such as aerospace, defence, and medicine, ASICs and FPGAs need to be designed to
be fault tolerant to prevent catastrophic malfunctions. In the context of digital electronics, fault tolerant
means that the design is able to gracefully recover and continue operating in the event of a fault, or upset.</p>
<p>For systems that operate in space - whether that be low-Earth orbit (LEO) or deep space - we care most about
Single-Event Upsets (SEUs). SEUs are caused when ionising radiation strikes a transistor, causing it to
transition from a 1 to a 0, or vice versa.</p>
<p>In space, the Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere is absent, and thus chips are completely unprotected from the ever-present
threat of radiation. This radiation can come from many sources: stray cosmic rays, violent bursts from the Sun, or even
extremely powerful extragalactic gamma-ray bursts. On an unprotected system, an unlucky SEU may corrupt the system’s
state to such a severe degree that it may cause destruction or loss of life - particularly important given the
safety-critical nature of a number of space-faring systems (satellites, crew capsules, etc).</p>
<p>One way we can protect against SEUs is a design technique called Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR), which
mitigates SEUs by triplicating key parts of the design and using voter circuits to select a non-corrupted
result if an SEU occurs. Typically, TMR is manually designed by HDL designers, for example, by
manually instantiating three copies of the target module, designing a voter circuit, and linking them all
together. However, this approach is an additional time-consuming and potentially error-prone step in the
already complex design pipeline.</p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice if, instead, we could just have our synthesis tool do this for us? You input a design, and
a simple <code>tmr</code> command makes it reliable enough to run in space, with barely any extra effort?</p>
<p>This may still be a pipe-dream, but was the goal of my thesis to explore.</p>
<h2 id="introducing-tamara">
    <a href="#introducing-tamara" class="header-anchor">#</a>
    Introducing TaMaRa
</h2><p><em>TaMaRa</em> is the name for my implementation of this as a pass in Yosys. Once compiled, it introduces one new
command: <code>tamara_tmr</code>, which aims to introduce TMR into the circuit. It also automatically calculates an <code>err</code>
signal that is set high when a fault occurs, which can be used to, for example, re-configure an FPGA or reboot
an ASIC.</p>
<p>Designers should only need to make one change to the design, which is to introduce the <code>(* tamara_error_sink *)</code>
annotation on the signal they would like to use as the error signal. This will indicate to the tool which port
should be wired up to the automatically generated error signal logic.</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>If you are hoping to use TaMaRa on an existing project - there is some bad news. Unfortunately, we have very
little time in Honours, and <strong>TaMaRa is absolutely not suitable for any real-world designs</strong> yet. In fact, it
was only able to process a small number of simple test circuits and has a number of documented bugs on
moderately complex designs. Think of it more as a proof of concept.</p>
<h2 id="tamara---under-the-hood">
    <a href="#tamara---under-the-hood" class="header-anchor">#</a>
    TaMaRa - Under the hood
</h2><p>TaMaRa operates on Yosys&rsquo; powerful RTLIL or RTL Intermediate Language. All Yosys frontends emit this
intermediate representation after pre-processing, lexing, parsing and elaboration. This is a very powerful
feature of Yosys - it means that the same underlying plugin can operate on any design, from Verilog, to
SystemVerilog, to VHDL.</p>
<p>From a high-level perspective, the TaMaRa algorithm can be summarised as follows:</p>
<ol>

<p>From an implementation perspective, the TaMaRa plugin consists of just over 2,300 lines of C++20. The class
diagram of the implementation looks (mostly) like this:</p>
<p><img src="/static-2025/tamara/classdiagram.svg"
	
	
	
	loading="lazy"
	
		alt="TaMaRa TMR class diagram"
	
	
></p>
<p>TaMaRa works by first lifting the RTLIL into a higher-level, more abstract representation: an abstract
<code>TMRGraphNode</code> with <code>CellNode</code>, <code>IONode</code>, <code>WireNode</code> and <code>FFNode</code> specialisations. These in turn abstractly
represent the key parts of an RTLIL circuit we care about for TMR. With this, we can more easily build a
data structure mapping between these higher-level constructs and what other higher-level constructs they
connect to. Essentially, we&rsquo;re building an abstracted view of the netlist for the purposes of TMR.</p>
<p>One of the more important aspects is this algorithm is the concept of a <em>backwards breadth-first search</em>.
Working backwards from the output ports of a module, <em>towards</em> the input ports, we look to perform a data
structure known as a &ldquo;logic cone&rdquo; through a BFS.</p>
<p>Essentially, the logic cone encapsulates all of the combinatorial RTLIL primitives between a sequential
primitive (i.e. a DFF) or an IO (i.e. the edge of the circuit, the inputs). This diagram helps to better
illustrate a logic cone:</p>
<p><img src="/static-2025/tamara/logic_cone.svg"
	
	
	
	loading="lazy"
	
		alt="Logic cone"
	
	
></p>
<p>Once we have these logic cones, we can treat them independently to perform TMR. All of the primitives <em>within</em>
a single logic cone can be triplicated, and a voter circuit can be inserted on the output side of the logic
cone.</p>
<p>Insertion is no easy task - in the thesis, I refer to this as <em>splicing</em> or <em>wiring</em> and it remained one of
the most complex tasks of the project. RTLIL&rsquo;s power is a bit of a drawback here. As it&rsquo;s capable of
representing any RTL schematic at all, there are a number of edge cases to consider, and not all were able to
be considered in time.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot more nuance here than can realistically fit in a blog post, so if you&rsquo;re interested, I highly
encourage you to read my thesis and/or code. This goes into more detail about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Specifics about the backwards BFS including search termination conditions</li>
<li>Specifically <em>how</em> splicing is done</li>
<li>How the voter circuit was generated using a Karnaugh map of an expression then translated into C++ macros</li>
<li>The general purpose <code>FixWalker</code> and <code>FixWalkerManager</code> classes for post-algorithm netlist repair</li>

    Verification
</h2><p>For the safety critical sectors that this tool (ideally) targets, verification is extremely important. It&rsquo;s
clear that the Yosys team has put a lot of effort into its verification tooling, and it shows. I was able to
use a number of Yosys tools during the thesis: SymbiYosys, eqy, mcy, Yosys&rsquo; built-in SAT solver, the <code>mutate</code>
command, and external SMT solvers.</p>
<p>I performed equivalence checking between circuits, before and after TMR, to ensure that TaMaRa does not change
the underlying behaviour of the circuit. In addition, I used Herklotz&rsquo;s
<a class="link" href="https://github.com/ymherklotz/verismith"  target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >Verismith</a> tool to generate random Verilog RTL in large batches,
over 10,000 files per run, and run the equivalence check. This enabled me to verify the integrity of the
algorithm at scale.</p>
<p>By using Yosys&rsquo; built-in <code>mutate</code> command, I was also able to use the SAT-based equivalence checker to ensure
that faults were correctly mitigated. If, after injecting a fault and applying TMR, the circuit is
equivalent to its non-fault-injected counterpart, then the TMR has worked. Likewise, we can use the SAT solver
to ensure that the <code>err</code> signal is set high when a fault is actually injected.</p>
<p><img src="/static-2025/tamara/verification.svg"
	
	
	
	loading="lazy"
	
		alt="Verification flow"
	
	
></p>
<p>This shows that formal verification is a powerful technique to use when designing EDA algorithms, not just for
IC design itself. There&rsquo;s certainly more work I&rsquo;d like to perform in this area in future - perhaps fuzzing
Yosys optimisation passes at scale to verify their correctness.</p>
<h2 id="results">
    <a href="#results" class="header-anchor">#</a>
    Results
</h2><p>In the end, due to time constraints (and I must admit, poor project planning), TaMaRa was only able to handle
simple circuits. This <em>does</em> include some circuits using sequential primitives, but again, only simple ones.</p>
<p>To have a look at what the algorithm is capable of, here is a very simple circuit displayed with Yosys&rsquo; <code>show</code>
command. This particular circuit uses a 2-bit bus, feeding into a simple NOT gate.</p>
<p><img src="/static-2025/tamara/not_2bit.svg"
	
	
	
	loading="lazy"
	
		alt="not_2bit schematic"
	
	
></p>
<p>Now, after applying <code>tamara_tmr</code>, you can see that the NOT gate has been replicated, and the TMR voter and error
calculation logic has been inserted:</p>
<p><img src="/static-2025/tamara/not_2bit_tmr.svg"
	
	
	
	loading="lazy"
	
		alt="not_2bit schematic after TMR"
	
	
></p>
<p>Because of the 2-bit bus, two voters are required, which is the reason this schematic has dramatically
inflated in size from the original. You&rsquo;ll also be able to see the <code>$reduce_or</code> cell that has been inserted
to combine the individual <code>err</code> signals of both the voters.</p>
<p>With the algorithm applied, we can also use the formal verification methodology above to analyse, at a larger
scale, how these protected circuits respond to injected faults. In the following graph, an
&ldquo;Unmitigated circuit&rdquo; refers to a pre-TMR circuit; and an &ldquo;Unprotected voter&rdquo; circuit refers to a circuit with
a voter, subject to fault injection, where the voter may also be hit with faults as well. For each of the
samples on the X axis, 100 randomised trials were used and the outputs formally verified.</p>
<p><img src="/static-2025/tamara/graphs.png"
	
	
	
	loading="lazy"
	
		alt="TaMaRa graphs"
	
	
></p>
<p>This result shows that while the algorithm isn&rsquo;t <em>perfect</em> in close-to-real-world scenarios, it <em>does</em> improve
the reliability of the circuit somewhat. Unprotected circuits are almost always affected by simulated SEUs,
whereas after being processed with TaMaRa TMR, mitigated circuits have above a 50% chance of mitigating the
SEU.</p>
<p>All circuits tested generally perform the same, regardless of topology:</p>

		alt="All unprotected voters"

<p>Individual circuits also appear to respond identically regardless of bit width:</p>

    <a href="#whats-next" class="header-anchor">#</a>
    What&rsquo;s next?
</h2><p>In 2026, I&rsquo;m moving to start a PhD at Macquarie University&rsquo;s
<a class="link" href="https://www.mq.edu.au/faculty-of-science-and-engineering/our-research/silicon-platforms-lab"  target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >Silicon Platforms Lab</a>,
one of the very few computer engineering focused research groups in Australia.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m planning to continue my work on domain-specific EDA, but focus more heavily on Yosys&rsquo; sister project,
<a class="link" href="https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD"  target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >OpenROAD</a>, an RTL-GDS tool for ASICs. In the case of
radiation-hardening, performing this mitigation lower-down in the stack (i.e. during physical design/PnR) has
the advantage of being able to more accurately consider the physical effects of radiation on the circuit. This
type of information can be approximated, but is hard to accurately predict, at a synthesis pre-PnR level.</p>
<p>There are many fields that don&rsquo;t suit typical, commercial EDA flows that focus on power, performance and area
(PPA) exclusively, from radiation-hardened designs to high-security processors. Proprietary tools barricade
research into this area by making them impossible to modify. Conversely, FOSS tools like Yosys and OpenROAD
give us a unique opportunity, as researchers, to customise these tools to our specific areas of interest and
improve the tool in the process. For example, during my PhD, I&rsquo;m hoping to improve both Yosys and OpenROAD,
focusing on Layout Versus Schematic (LVS) and other verification techniques. My research, and increasingly
others&rsquo; as well, uses Yosys and OpenROAD for high-security and/or safety critical environments. Given this,
it&rsquo;s important that when we modify a tool, we know we haven&rsquo;t regressed its behaviour.</p>
<p>My hope is that if more academics and small companies become interested in FOSS EDA tools and contribute to
them, we will eventually be able to have a powerful, community-led chip design pipeline that could rival
commercial tools across a number of domains. This, I believe, would make IC design an endeavour more suitable
for hobbyists and academics without access to expensive proprietary tools; and unlock opportunities for
interesting new innovations in the EDA sector.</p>
