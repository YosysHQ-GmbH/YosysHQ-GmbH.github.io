        <description>&lt;img src="http://blog.yosyshq.com/static-2023/YOS_horiz.png" alt="Featured image of post Tabby CAD Suite version 20250807 released!" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The August release of Tabby CAD Suite is now available for download. Notable changes in this version include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SBY: it is now possible to symlink the files listed in the &lt;code&gt;[files]&lt;/code&gt; section instead of copying them to the SBY task directory by invoking it with the &lt;code&gt;sby --link&lt;/code&gt; option. This saves disk space when running many separate tasks on a large design.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SBY: added the ability to cancel another task when a task finishes. This can be used e.g. to cancel a bounded model check when an unbounded proof succeeds. See documentation of the new &lt;code&gt;[cancelledby]&lt;/code&gt; section &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://yosyshq.readthedocs.io/projects/sby/en/latest/reference.html#cancelledby-section&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yosys: Fixed a bug where verific flags would get reset incorrectly after import, setting different default settings for subsequent frontend invocations in the same run.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;foreword&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#foreword&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    Foreword
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although I&amp;rsquo;m a computer scientist by education, I&amp;rsquo;ve always been interested in space since I was a kid. For a
long time, I had simply forgotten about this interest, as I got more in-depth into FPGAs, then ASICs, and
eventually EDA. I had no idea that eventually, an incredible opportunity would come to combine these two
together, thanks to Yosys!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In late 2023, I pitched a research project to my academic supervisor at the University of Queensland in
Australia. Here, we have a degree &amp;ldquo;Bachelor of Computer Science (Honours)&amp;rdquo; that is somewhat similar to a
Master&amp;rsquo;s degree as it involves a one-year research thesis. At the time, I had simply pitched the design and
implementation of a simple RISC-V microcontroller. As my supervisor pointed out, this is a fun project, but
has little to no research potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we brainstormed ways to improve the project, I recalled hearing about a &lt;em&gt;Super Mario 64&lt;/em&gt; speedrun that was
allegedly disrupted by a random bit flip caused by a stray cosmic ray. As I did more serious research into
this topic, I found a very interesting research field with all sorts of interesting trade-offs, on top of the
ones you get in normal FPGA/ASIC design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I quickly realised that far more than just designing &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; fault-tolerant processor, it could be possible to
design a generalised EDA flow that could make &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; processor fault-tolerant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, I was already familiar with Yosys. In Australia, unlike Europe and the US, we do not currently
have a very large or well-resourced domestic FPGA/ASIC research community. This means that, as university
students and researchers, we don&amp;rsquo;t often (or ever) have access to industry tools like Cadence and
Synopsys, so I had started my FPGA work using purely open-source tools. This, in fact, turns out to be a
blessing in disguise. I&amp;rsquo;m passionate about FOSS tools, and Yosys - being open-source - allows you to peel back
the hood and deeply understand &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; it does certain synthesis passes, which allows for really deep learning,
plus the opportunity to improve the tool yourself. Very importantly, it also means that custom passes can
easily be added, which is not at all possible with restrictive commercial tools. This makes it a very
important tool in academia, and indeed, Yosys is coming up in more and more publications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project I ended up pitching, and had approved, was titled, &amp;ldquo;An Automated Triple Modular Redundancy EDA
Flow for Yosys&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;background---what-is-triple-modular-redundancy&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#background---what-is-triple-modular-redundancy&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    Background - What is Triple Modular Redundancy?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For safety-critical sectors such as aerospace, defence, and medicine, ASICs and FPGAs need to be designed to
be fault tolerant to prevent catastrophic malfunctions. In the context of digital electronics, fault tolerant
means that the design is able to gracefully recover and continue operating in the event of a fault, or upset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For systems that operate in space - whether that be low-Earth orbit (LEO) or deep space - we care most about
Single-Event Upsets (SEUs). SEUs are caused when ionising radiation strikes a transistor, causing it to
transition from a 1 to a 0, or vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In space, the Earth&amp;rsquo;s atmosphere is absent, and thus chips are completely unprotected from the ever-present
threat of radiation. This radiation can come from many sources: stray cosmic rays, violent bursts from the Sun, or even
extremely powerful extragalactic gamma-ray bursts. On an unprotected system, an unlucky SEU may corrupt the system’s
state to such a severe degree that it may cause destruction or loss of life - particularly important given the
safety-critical nature of a number of space-faring systems (satellites, crew capsules, etc).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way we can protect against SEUs is a design technique called Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR), which
mitigates SEUs by triplicating key parts of the design and using voter circuits to select a non-corrupted
result if an SEU occurs. Typically, TMR is manually designed by HDL designers, for example, by
manually instantiating three copies of the target module, designing a voter circuit, and linking them all
together. However, this approach is an additional time-consuming and potentially error-prone step in the
already complex design pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be nice if, instead, we could just have our synthesis tool do this for us? You input a design, and
a simple &lt;code&gt;tmr&lt;/code&gt; command makes it reliable enough to run in space, with barely any extra effort?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may still be a pipe-dream, but was the goal of my thesis to explore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;introducing-tamara&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#introducing-tamara&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    Introducing TaMaRa
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;TaMaRa&lt;/em&gt; is the name for my implementation of this as a pass in Yosys. Once compiled, it introduces one new
command: &lt;code&gt;tamara_tmr&lt;/code&gt;, which aims to introduce TMR into the circuit. It also automatically calculates an &lt;code&gt;err&lt;/code&gt;
signal that is set high when a fault occurs, which can be used to, for example, re-configure an FPGA or reboot
an ASIC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Designers should only need to make one change to the design, which is to introduce the &lt;code&gt;(* tamara_error_sink *)&lt;/code&gt;
annotation on the signal they would like to use as the error signal. This will indicate to the tool which port
should be wired up to the automatically generated error signal logic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;err&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;endmodule&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are hoping to use TaMaRa on an existing project - there is some bad news. Unfortunately, we have very
little time in Honours, and &lt;strong&gt;TaMaRa is absolutely not suitable for any real-world designs&lt;/strong&gt; yet. In fact, it
was only able to process a small number of simple test circuits and has a number of documented bugs on
moderately complex designs. Think of it more as a proof of concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;tamara---under-the-hood&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#tamara---under-the-hood&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    TaMaRa - Under the hood
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;TaMaRa operates on Yosys&amp;rsquo; powerful RTLIL or RTL Intermediate Language. All Yosys frontends emit this
intermediate representation after pre-processing, lexing, parsing and elaboration. This is a very powerful
feature of Yosys - it means that the same underlying plugin can operate on any design, from Verilog, to
SystemVerilog, to VHDL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a high-level perspective, the TaMaRa algorithm can be summarised as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Analyse the RTLIL netlist to generate &lt;code&gt;tamara::RTLILWireConnections&lt;/code&gt; mapping; which is a mapping between an
RTLIL Cell or Wire and the other Cells or Wires it may be connected to&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For each output port in the top module:
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perform a backwards breadth-first search through the RTLIL netlist to form a logic cone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Replicate all combinational RTLIL primitives inside the logic cone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generate and insert the necessary voter(s) for each bit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wire up the newly formed netlist, including connected the voters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perform any necessary fixes to the wiring, if required&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With the initial search complete, compute any follow on/successor logic cones from the initial terminals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repeat step 2 but for each successor logic cone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continue until no more successors remain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also summarised by this diagram:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.yosyshq.com/static-2025/tamara/algorithm.svg&#34;

		alt=&#34;TaMaRa TMR algorithm&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From an implementation perspective, the TaMaRa plugin consists of just over 2,300 lines of C++20. The class
diagram of the implementation looks (mostly) like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.yosyshq.com/static-2025/tamara/classdiagram.svg&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;TaMaRa TMR class diagram&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TaMaRa works by first lifting the RTLIL into a higher-level, more abstract representation: an abstract
&lt;code&gt;TMRGraphNode&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;CellNode&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;IONode&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;WireNode&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;FFNode&lt;/code&gt; specialisations. These in turn abstractly
represent the key parts of an RTLIL circuit we care about for TMR. With this, we can more easily build a
data structure mapping between these higher-level constructs and what other higher-level constructs they
connect to. Essentially, we&amp;rsquo;re building an abstracted view of the netlist for the purposes of TMR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the more important aspects is this algorithm is the concept of a &lt;em&gt;backwards breadth-first search&lt;/em&gt;.
Working backwards from the output ports of a module, &lt;em&gt;towards&lt;/em&gt; the input ports, we look to perform a data
structure known as a &amp;ldquo;logic cone&amp;rdquo; through a BFS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially, the logic cone encapsulates all of the combinatorial RTLIL primitives between a sequential
primitive (i.e. a DFF) or an IO (i.e. the edge of the circuit, the inputs). This diagram helps to better
illustrate a logic cone:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.yosyshq.com/static-2025/tamara/logic_cone.svg&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Logic cone&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we have these logic cones, we can treat them independently to perform TMR. All of the primitives &lt;em&gt;within&lt;/em&gt;
a single logic cone can be triplicated, and a voter circuit can be inserted on the output side of the logic
cone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insertion is no easy task - in the thesis, I refer to this as &lt;em&gt;splicing&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;wiring&lt;/em&gt; and it remained one of
the most complex tasks of the project. RTLIL&amp;rsquo;s power is a bit of a drawback here. As it&amp;rsquo;s capable of
representing any RTL schematic at all, there are a number of edge cases to consider, and not all were able to
be considered in time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a lot more nuance here than can realistically fit in a blog post, so if you&amp;rsquo;re interested, I highly
encourage you to read my thesis and/or code. This goes into more detail about:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Specifics about the backwards BFS including search termination conditions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Specifically &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; splicing is done&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How the voter circuit was generated using a Karnaugh map of an expression then translated into C++ macros&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The general purpose &lt;code&gt;FixWalker&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;FixWalkerManager&lt;/code&gt; classes for post-algorithm netlist repair&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;verification&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#verification&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    Verification
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the safety critical sectors that this tool (ideally) targets, verification is extremely important. It&amp;rsquo;s
clear that the Yosys team has put a lot of effort into its verification tooling, and it shows. I was able to
use a number of Yosys tools during the thesis: SymbiYosys, eqy, mcy, Yosys&amp;rsquo; built-in SAT solver, the &lt;code&gt;mutate&lt;/code&gt;
command, and external SMT solvers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I performed equivalence checking between circuits, before and after TMR, to ensure that TaMaRa does not change
the underlying behaviour of the circuit. In addition, I used Herklotz&amp;rsquo;s
&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/ymherklotz/verismith&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Verismith&lt;/a&gt; tool to generate random Verilog RTL in large batches,
over 10,000 files per run, and run the equivalence check. This enabled me to verify the integrity of the
algorithm at scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By using Yosys&amp;rsquo; built-in &lt;code&gt;mutate&lt;/code&gt; command, I was also able to use the SAT-based equivalence checker to ensure
that faults were correctly mitigated. If, after injecting a fault and applying TMR, the circuit is
equivalent to its non-fault-injected counterpart, then the TMR has worked. Likewise, we can use the SAT solver
to ensure that the &lt;code&gt;err&lt;/code&gt; signal is set high when a fault is actually injected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.yosyshq.com/static-2025/tamara/verification.svg&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Verification flow&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This shows that formal verification is a powerful technique to use when designing EDA algorithms, not just for
IC design itself. There&amp;rsquo;s certainly more work I&amp;rsquo;d like to perform in this area in future - perhaps fuzzing
Yosys optimisation passes at scale to verify their correctness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;results&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#results&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    Results
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, due to time constraints (and I must admit, poor project planning), TaMaRa was only able to handle
simple circuits. This &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; include some circuits using sequential primitives, but again, only simple ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To have a look at what the algorithm is capable of, here is a very simple circuit displayed with Yosys&amp;rsquo; &lt;code&gt;show&lt;/code&gt;
command. This particular circuit uses a 2-bit bus, feeding into a simple NOT gate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.yosyshq.com/static-2025/tamara/not_2bit.svg&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;not_2bit schematic&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, after applying &lt;code&gt;tamara_tmr&lt;/code&gt;, you can see that the NOT gate has been replicated, and the TMR voter and error
calculation logic has been inserted:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.yosyshq.com/static-2025/tamara/not_2bit_tmr.svg&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;not_2bit schematic after TMR&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the 2-bit bus, two voters are required, which is the reason this schematic has dramatically
inflated in size from the original. You&amp;rsquo;ll also be able to see the &lt;code&gt;$reduce_or&lt;/code&gt; cell that has been inserted
to combine the individual &lt;code&gt;err&lt;/code&gt; signals of both the voters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the algorithm applied, we can also use the formal verification methodology above to analyse, at a larger
scale, how these protected circuits respond to injected faults. In the following graph, an
&amp;ldquo;Unmitigated circuit&amp;rdquo; refers to a pre-TMR circuit; and an &amp;ldquo;Unprotected voter&amp;rdquo; circuit refers to a circuit with
a voter, subject to fault injection, where the voter may also be hit with faults as well. For each of the
samples on the X axis, 100 randomised trials were used and the outputs formally verified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.yosyshq.com/static-2025/tamara/graphs.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;TaMaRa graphs&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This result shows that while the algorithm isn&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;perfect&lt;/em&gt; in close-to-real-world scenarios, it &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; improve
the reliability of the circuit somewhat. Unprotected circuits are almost always affected by simulated SEUs,
whereas after being processed with TaMaRa TMR, mitigated circuits have above a 50% chance of mitigating the
SEU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All circuits tested generally perform the same, regardless of topology:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2026, I&amp;rsquo;m moving to start a PhD at Macquarie University&amp;rsquo;s
&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.mq.edu.au/faculty-of-science-and-engineering/our-research/silicon-platforms-lab&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Silicon Platforms Lab&lt;/a&gt;,
one of the very few computer engineering focused research groups in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m planning to continue my work on domain-specific EDA, but focus more heavily on Yosys&amp;rsquo; sister project,
&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;OpenROAD&lt;/a&gt;, an RTL-GDS tool for ASICs. In the case of
radiation-hardening, performing this mitigation lower-down in the stack (i.e. during physical design/PnR) has
the advantage of being able to more accurately consider the physical effects of radiation on the circuit. This
type of information can be approximated, but is hard to accurately predict, at a synthesis pre-PnR level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many fields that don&amp;rsquo;t suit typical, commercial EDA flows that focus on power, performance and area
(PPA) exclusively, from radiation-hardened designs to high-security processors. Proprietary tools barricade
research into this area by making them impossible to modify. Conversely, FOSS tools like Yosys and OpenROAD
give us a unique opportunity, as researchers, to customise these tools to our specific areas of interest and
improve the tool in the process. For example, during my PhD, I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to improve both Yosys and OpenROAD,
focusing on Layout Versus Schematic (LVS) and other verification techniques. My research, and increasingly
others&amp;rsquo; as well, uses Yosys and OpenROAD for high-security and/or safety critical environments. Given this,
it&amp;rsquo;s important that when we modify a tool, we know we haven&amp;rsquo;t regressed its behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My hope is that if more academics and small companies become interested in FOSS EDA tools and contribute to
them, we will eventually be able to have a powerful, community-led chip design pipeline that could rival
commercial tools across a number of domains. This, I believe, would make IC design an endeavour more suitable
for hobbyists and academics without access to expensive proprietary tools; and unlock opportunities for
interesting new innovations in the EDA sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;SBY: The handling of assertions in cover mode was changed; now by default it will not consider assertions at all, and in particular it will no longer fail the cover task if any assertions were violated during the cover traces. You can restore the original behavior by adding the option &lt;code&gt;cover_assert on&lt;/code&gt; to the &lt;code&gt;[options]&lt;/code&gt; section.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The default severity for several verific warnings has been downgraded to INFO, as they are commonly seen in projects and usually do not indicate a problem with the design:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[VERI-1209] foo.sv:98: expression size 7 truncated to fit in target size 6 &lt;br&gt;
[VERI-1142] foo.sv:55: system task &amp;lsquo;display&amp;rsquo; is ignored for synthesis &lt;br&gt;
[VERI-2418] foo.svh:503: parameter &amp;lsquo;foo&amp;rsquo; declared inside package &amp;lsquo;bar_pkg&amp;rsquo; shall be treated as localparam \&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you would like to continue receiving any of these warnings, you can run the command &lt;code&gt;verific -set-warning VERI-XXXX&lt;/code&gt; at the beginning of your script to change the severity level back to WARNING.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;img src="http://blog.yosyshq.com/static-2025/Sby.png" alt="Featured image of post RISC-V Formal Verification Framework Extension for Synopsys VC Formal" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;This guest blog post was written by &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/v-rohith-km/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

    RISC-V Formal Verification Framework Extension for Synopsys VC Formal
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine deploying a RISC-V processor in an embedded system, only to discover an instruction-level bug after manufacturing—this could be a costly mistake. Formal verification ensures that such issues never make it past the design phase, and tools like &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/YosysHQ/riscv-formal&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;riscv-formal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; help automate this process. However, many engineers rely on proprietary tools like &lt;strong&gt;Synopsys VC Formal&lt;/strong&gt;, making integration with open-source solutions a challenge—until now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;riscv-formal&lt;/code&gt; framework has been a game-changer, providing an open-source solution for verifying RISC-V cores against the official ISA specification. While powerful, its integration with industry-grade proprietary tools has remained complex. This project bridges that gap by extending &lt;code&gt;riscv-formal&lt;/code&gt; to seamlessly interface with &lt;strong&gt;Synopsys VC Formal&lt;/strong&gt;, enabling engineers to harness its advanced capabilities while maintaining a structured and efficient verification approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post, we’ll explore the role of formal verification in RISC-V core validation, the motivation behind this integration, and the methodology that makes it possible. Ultimately, this extension enhances accessibility and usability, providing the broader verification community with a streamlined, industry-compatible solution.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;a href=&#34;#before-we-dive-in&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    Before We Dive In&amp;hellip;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before diving into the project, let&amp;rsquo;s take a quick look at the &lt;code&gt;riscv-formal&lt;/code&gt; framework and understand why it plays a crucial role in RISC-V core verification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-is-riscv-formal&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-is-riscv-formal&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    What is &lt;code&gt;riscv-formal&lt;/code&gt;?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;riscv-formal&lt;/code&gt; is an &lt;strong&gt;open-source formal verification framework&lt;/strong&gt; designed to rigorously verify RISC-V processors against the RISC-V ISA specification. Built on the &lt;strong&gt;FOSS SymbiYosys Formal Verification Flow&lt;/strong&gt;, it ensures that a processor implementation behaves correctly at the instruction and architectural levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;why-is-riscv-formal-important&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#why-is-riscv-formal-important&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    Why is &lt;code&gt;riscv-formal&lt;/code&gt; Important?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automated Property Checking:&lt;/strong&gt; Ensures compliance with the RISC-V ISA without requiring manual testbenches.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Minimal Setup, Maximum Coverage:&lt;/strong&gt; Works with any RISC-V design using an RISC-V Formal Interface (RVFI) wrapper.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-it-works&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#how-it-works&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    How it Works
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RVFI Wrapper&lt;/strong&gt;: Wraps the core-under-test with an RVFI-compliant interface for compatibility.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Formal Checkers&lt;/strong&gt;: A set of predefined checkers checks the whole core thoroughly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Verification Engines&lt;/strong&gt;: Uses predefined assertions and constraints to validate core behavior.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Counterexample Analysis&lt;/strong&gt;: If a check fails, it generates a trace of execution (CEX) to debug violations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;limitations--extending-to-proprietary-tools&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#limitations--extending-to-proprietary-tools&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    Limitations &amp;amp; Extending to Proprietary Tools
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While &lt;code&gt;riscv-formal&lt;/code&gt; is highly effective for open-source formal verification, its native tooling (SBY/Yosys) &lt;strong&gt;does not support proprietary EDA tools&lt;/strong&gt;. This is where our &lt;strong&gt;extension&lt;/strong&gt; comes in—adapting &lt;code&gt;riscv-formal&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;strong&gt;Synopsys VC Formal&lt;/strong&gt;, bridging the gap between open-source and commercial verification flows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;project-goals&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#project-goals&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    Project Goals
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;By adapting the &lt;code&gt;riscv-formal&lt;/code&gt; framework (originally built for SymbiYosys) to work with &lt;strong&gt;Synopsys VC Formal&lt;/strong&gt;, this project aims to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seamless Integration with VC Formal&lt;/strong&gt; – Ensure that &lt;code&gt;riscv-formal&lt;/code&gt; works effortlessly with &lt;strong&gt;Synopsys VC Formal&lt;/strong&gt;, simplifying the verification process without requiring extensive modifications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improve Usability&lt;/strong&gt; – Deliver clear documentation and practical examples to help engineers effectively apply the framework.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enable Easy &lt;code&gt;.sby → .tcl&lt;/code&gt; Conversion&lt;/strong&gt; – Support straightforward translation of &lt;code&gt;.sby&lt;/code&gt; configurations into &lt;code&gt;.tcl&lt;/code&gt; scripts, even outside the framework.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By achieving these goals, the project enhances the &lt;strong&gt;efficiency, accessibility, and adoption&lt;/strong&gt; of formal verification for RISC-V cores, fostering wider collaboration in the verification community.&lt;/p&gt;

    Key Challenges in Transitioning to VC Formal
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conversion from SymbiYosys Flow:&lt;/strong&gt; The &lt;code&gt;.sby&lt;/code&gt; configuration files used in riscv-formal are specific to SymbiYosys. VC Formal, on the other hand, operates using &lt;code&gt;Tcl-based&lt;/code&gt; scripts, requiring a structured translation mechanism to adapt the verification flow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Environment Setup &amp;amp; Automation:&lt;/strong&gt; Automating the process—so that users can easily set up VC Formal verification with minimal manual intervention—was a key goal in this adaptation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;verification-process&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#verification-process&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;

    &lt;a href=&#34;#i-foss-symbiyosys-formal-verification-flow&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    i. FOSS SymbiYosys Formal Verification Flow
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This flow demonstrates the formal verification process using the riscv-formal framework with the open-source SymbiYosys tool. It consists of components like RVFI, the wrapper, and &lt;code&gt;checks.cfg&lt;/code&gt;. These components are used to generate &lt;code&gt;.sby&lt;/code&gt; files, which are then processed by SymbiYosys to run verification checks and produce the results, ensuring that the RISC-V implementation adheres to formal specifications. This flow represents a streamlined, FOSS-based approach to formal verification.&lt;/p&gt;

    ii. Synopsys VC Formal Verification Flow
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This flow illustrates the modified process, where the riscv-formal framework is used with Synopsys VC Formal. The &lt;code&gt;.sby&lt;/code&gt; files from the riscv-formal framework are first converted to &lt;code&gt;.tcl&lt;/code&gt; scripts using a custom &lt;code&gt;sby to tcl&lt;/code&gt; converter before being processed by VC Formal to generate verification results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.yosyshq.com/static-2025/VCF.png&#34;

		alt=&#34;Synopsys VC Formal verification flow&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The framework consists of &lt;strong&gt;three key stages&lt;/strong&gt;, each automated for smooth verification:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pre-Processing:&lt;/strong&gt; Converts &lt;code&gt;.sby&lt;/code&gt; files into &lt;code&gt;.tcl&lt;/code&gt; scripts for VC Formal compatibility.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Processing:&lt;/strong&gt; Runs the formal checks, collects logs, and categorizes warnings &amp;amp; errors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Post-Processing:&lt;/strong&gt; Summarizes verification results, helping users quickly identify pass/fail conditions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To achieve this, we’ve extended the framework with four core components:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-sby_to_tclpy--automating-test-setup-pre-processing&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#1-sby_to_tclpy--automating-test-setup-pre-processing&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    1️⃣ sby_to_tcl.py – Automating Test Setup (Pre-Processing)
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;sby_to_tcl.py&lt;/code&gt; script automates the &lt;strong&gt;conversion of SymbiYosys &lt;code&gt;.sby&lt;/code&gt; files&lt;/strong&gt; into &lt;strong&gt;VC Formal-compatible &lt;code&gt;.tcl&lt;/code&gt; scripts&lt;/strong&gt;. It also &lt;strong&gt;creates a Makefile&lt;/strong&gt; that organizes multiple verification tasks, allowing batch execution with a single command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;-why-is-this-important&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#-why-is-this-important&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    🔹 Why is this important?
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eliminates manual effort in handling &lt;code&gt;.tcl&lt;/code&gt; files.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enables batch verification by processing multiple &lt;code&gt;.sby&lt;/code&gt; files at once.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Organizes output systematically in a dedicated &lt;code&gt;vcf&lt;/code&gt; directory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-vcf_cexdatash--error--warning-processing-processing-stage&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#2-vcf_cexdatash--error--warning-processing-processing-stage&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    2️⃣ vcf_cexdata.sh – Error &amp;amp; Warning Processing (Processing Stage)
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the verification execution, the &lt;code&gt;vcf_cexdata.sh&lt;/code&gt; script ensures &lt;strong&gt;structured handling of warnings and errors&lt;/strong&gt;. Instead of overwriting logs, it captures and organizes logs for all checks, ensuring every warning/error is properly recorded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;-key-features&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#-key-features&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    🔹 Key Features:
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prevents loss of information by storing logs separately.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Formats errors in an easy-to-read structure (&lt;code&gt;warnings.txt&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;errors.txt&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provides a quick summary of issues across multiple checks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;3-vcf_res_processpy--summarizing-verification-results-post-processing&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#3-vcf_res_processpy--summarizing-verification-results-post-processing&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    3️⃣ vcf_res_process.py – Summarizing Verification Results (Post-Processing)
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After verification, &lt;code&gt;vcf_res_process.py&lt;/code&gt; extracts key results from each check, categorizing assertions as &lt;strong&gt;PASS, FAIL, or INCONCLUSIVE&lt;/strong&gt; and consolidating everything into a &lt;strong&gt;single summary file (&lt;code&gt;results.txt&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;-why-does-this-matter&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#-why-does-this-matter&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    🔹 Why does this matter?
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Saves time—no need to inspect multiple files manually.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provides a high-level overview of all formal verification checks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Helps users quickly identify issues that need further debugging.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;4-makefile--automating-the-entire-workflow&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#4-makefile--automating-the-entire-workflow&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    4️⃣ Makefile – Automating the Entire Workflow
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Makefile&lt;/strong&gt; serves as the backbone of automation, orchestrating all three stages. With simple commands like &lt;code&gt;make vcf_check&lt;/code&gt;, users can run all checks, collect results, and review summaries &lt;strong&gt;without manually executing scripts&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;-key-features-1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#-key-features-1&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    🔹 Key Features:
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One-command execution of all verification steps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automated log collection &amp;amp; clean-up for an organized workflow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Results displayed directly in the terminal for quick review.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a &lt;strong&gt;more detailed breakdown&lt;/strong&gt; on each file/process, check out the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/Chaotic-VRBlue/riscv-formal-vc-formal-extension?tab=readme-ov-file#file-descriptions&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;general-applicability&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#general-applicability&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    General Applicability
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;An interesting aspect of this process is that it is &lt;strong&gt;not exclusive to &lt;code&gt;riscv-formal&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. In fact, this approach can be adapted for any &lt;code&gt;.sby&lt;/code&gt; file(s). The automation framework we&amp;rsquo;ve built for converting &lt;code&gt;.sby&lt;/code&gt; files to &lt;code&gt;.tcl&lt;/code&gt; scripts, handling formal verification results, and structuring the workflow can be applied to a wide range of formal verification tasks beyond RISC-V.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This flexibility makes it a powerful solution for integrating SymbiYosys-based verification flows with commercial formal tools like Synopsys VC Formal, streamlining the entire process across different projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;going-the-other-way-from-vc-formal-to-sby&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#going-the-other-way-from-vc-formal-to-sby&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    Going the Other Way: From VC Formal to SBY
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s go the other way for a bit—what if we want to take &lt;code&gt;.tcl&lt;/code&gt; files from VC Formal and convert them back into &lt;code&gt;.sby&lt;/code&gt; files for SymbiYosys?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;initial-challenges-faced-with-symbiyosys&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#initial-challenges-faced-with-symbiyosys&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    Initial Challenges Faced with SymbiYosys
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I first started using SymbiYosys (SBY) for formal verification, I encountered several challenges:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Toolchain Dependencies&lt;/strong&gt;: SBY relies on open-source tools like Yosys, Boolector, and ABC. Ensuring proper installation and configuration was time-consuming.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assertion Language Differences&lt;/strong&gt;: SystemVerilog Assertions (SVA) supported in VC Formal required workarounds in SBY due to syntax or feature limitations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite these hurdles, open-source formal verification tools have improved significantly and can handle complex verification tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;automating-the-conversion-from-tcl-to-sby&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#automating-the-conversion-from-tcl-to-sby&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    Automating the Conversion: From &lt;code&gt;.tcl&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;.sby&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scripting ideas used in our Python automation can serve as a foundation for reversing the process. Just like &lt;code&gt;sby_to_tcl.py&lt;/code&gt; converts &lt;code&gt;.sby&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;.tcl&lt;/code&gt;, a similar script could parse &lt;code&gt;.tcl&lt;/code&gt; files and generate &lt;code&gt;.sby&lt;/code&gt; files, but key challenges remain:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lack of Direct Equivalence&lt;/strong&gt;: VC Formal scripts contain proprietary directives that do not have an exact counterpart in SymbiYosys.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Complex Conversions&lt;/strong&gt;: While a fully automated VC Formal-to-SBY conversion may not be feasible, structured scripting can reduce manual effort significantly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, once the &lt;code&gt;.sby&lt;/code&gt; files are reconstructed, the existing &lt;strong&gt;riscv-formal automation&lt;/strong&gt;—Makefile execution, error handling, and result processing—remains intact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A structured conversion process would enable &lt;strong&gt;bidirectional compatibility&lt;/strong&gt; between open-source and proprietary formal verification tools.&lt;/p&gt;

    SymbiYosys Flow vs. VC Formal Flow
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comparison of &lt;strong&gt;SymbiYosys Flow&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Synopsys VC Formal (VCF)&lt;/strong&gt; flows:&lt;/p&gt;

    Future Scope
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extending to Other Proprietary Tools&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
While this extension integrates Synopsys VC Formal with riscv-formal, the approach can be further extended to other commercial formal verification tools. Automating &lt;code&gt;.sby&lt;/code&gt; file conversion and structured result handling can help streamline workflows across multiple environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maintaining Compatibility with File Format Changes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This extension relies on the &lt;code&gt;.sby&lt;/code&gt; file structure from riscv-formal and the &lt;code&gt;.tcl&lt;/code&gt; scripting format used by VC Formal. If either of these formats evolve, updates will be needed to ensure compatibility. Keeping the automation scripts adaptable to such modifications will be crucial for long-term usability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By continuously adapting, this extension can remain a valuable tool for formal verification, extending its reach to new tools and maintaining alignment with updates in the riscv-formal ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

    Results
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have successfully developed a complete extension that seamlessly integrates the &lt;strong&gt;riscv-formal framework&lt;/strong&gt; with &lt;strong&gt;Synopsys VC Formal (VCF)&lt;/strong&gt;, ensuring an efficient, automated, and user-friendly verification experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using this &lt;strong&gt;extended framework&lt;/strong&gt;, we formally verified our &lt;strong&gt;Single Cycle RISC-V core (SCRV32I)&lt;/strong&gt; and cross-checked results with &lt;strong&gt;SymbiYosys&lt;/strong&gt;. The verification confirms that our core adheres to the &lt;strong&gt;RISC-V ISA specifications&lt;/strong&gt;, ensuring correctness and compliance.&lt;/p&gt;

    🔍 Practical Example
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a detailed walkthrough, refer to this section of the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/Chaotic-VRBlue/riscv-formal-vc-formal-extension?tab=readme-ov-file#running-the-example-scrv32i-processor-for-understanding-the-workflow&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;complete repository on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;, where we provide a step-by-step guide to implementing this extension on the example SCRV32I processor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The below section is dedicated to guiding you through the process of configuring custom RISC-V designs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This practical approach ensures that users can replicate adapt, and extend the verification flow to their own processor designs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;configuring-a-new-risc-v-processor&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#configuring-a-new-risc-v-processor&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    Configuring a New RISC-V Processor
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, refer to the &lt;code&gt;riscv-formal&lt;/code&gt; repository and follow the steps outlined in the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/YosysHQ/riscv-formal?tab=readme-ov-file#configuring-a-new-risc-v-processor&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;riscv-formal guide&lt;/a&gt;. Complete everything up to step 5. You don&amp;rsquo;t need to run step 5, as it involves using an open-source tool. For our purpose, we will run it using the VC Formal tool, so step 5 can be skipped. If you&amp;rsquo;re interested, you can explore it, but it&amp;rsquo;s not required for this process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the &lt;code&gt;RVFI&lt;/code&gt; (RISC-V Formal Interface), &lt;code&gt;wrapper.sv&lt;/code&gt; file, and &lt;code&gt;checks.cfg&lt;/code&gt; file are implemented for your RISC-V processor as per the steps in the &lt;code&gt;riscv-formal&lt;/code&gt; repository, you can proceed with running the RISC-V formal framework for your core on the Synopsys VC Formal Tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Note: You may need to refer to the entire repository to complete this part, not just the section linked here.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copy the &lt;code&gt;vcf_cexdata.sh&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Makefile&lt;/code&gt; files from the &lt;code&gt;cores/scrv32i&lt;/code&gt; folder into your core folder. (Remember to copy the &lt;code&gt;vc_formal&lt;/code&gt; folder to the root directory if you have cloned the official &lt;code&gt;riscv-formal&lt;/code&gt; repository.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Note: Only the vc_formal folder in the root directory, the vcf_cexdata.sh file in the scrv32i folder, and a few additions to the Makefile inside the scrv32i directory were created to implement this extension. - So copy these files/folder to the right location and it should work with no hassle)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Navigate to your core directory and run:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; cores/&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;core&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;make vcf_clean
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;make vcf_check
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the process is complete, the terminal will display results in the following order:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Warnings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Errors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Verification results (PASS/FAIL/INCONCLUSIVE/UNKNOWN - If failed to run)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then you can utilize features such as running specific checks (including in GUI mode), launching the GUI, and customizing checks to run or skip, as shown in the &amp;lsquo;Running the Example SCRV32I Processor (For Understanding the Workflow)&amp;rsquo; section above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

    Bridging the Gap: RISC-V Formal Meets Synopsys VC Formal
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;RISC-V Formal Verification Framework Extension&lt;/strong&gt; for &lt;strong&gt;Synopsys VC Formal&lt;/strong&gt; bridges the gap between open-source and industry-grade proprietary tools, making formal verification more &lt;strong&gt;accessible, efficient, and scalable&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With &lt;strong&gt;automated .sby to .tcl conversion&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;structured result handling&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;batch execution support&lt;/strong&gt;, this extension simplifies the entire verification process for RISC-V cores—and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;but-this-is-just-the-beginning&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#but-this-is-just-the-beginning&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    But This Is Just the Beginning&amp;hellip;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The methodologies introduced here can be extended to other formal verification tasks, making it easier to integrate open-source flows with commercial EDA tools. Whether you’re using &lt;strong&gt;SymbiYosys&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;VC Formal&lt;/strong&gt;, or exploring &lt;strong&gt;bidirectional compatibility&lt;/strong&gt;, this framework lays the foundation for a more automated, scalable, and interoperable verification ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🔎 Want to dive deeper? Explore the &lt;strong&gt;full implementation&lt;/strong&gt; in the GitHub repository: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/Chaotic-VRBlue/riscv-formal-vc-formal-extension/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;riscv-formal-vc-formal-extension&lt;/a&gt; 🚀&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By embracing &lt;strong&gt;automation, interoperability, and scalability&lt;/strong&gt;, we can push the boundaries of formal verification—ensuring that RISC-V processors and other designs are functionally correct and future-proof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s build smarter, faster, and more robust verification flows—together! 🔬💡&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve added a new command &lt;code&gt;abstract&lt;/code&gt; that can be used to replace concrete signal values with unconstrained abstract values during formal verification. See the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://yosyshq.readthedocs.io/projects/yosys/en/latest/cmd/abstract.html&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

    &gt;we have now added support for the largest FPGA&lt;/a&gt; so far supported by open source tooling! 500,000 LUTs!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In November 2024 we successfully concluded the European Space Agency funded &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://activities.esa.int/4000141380&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;project&lt;/a&gt; in collaboration with &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://nanoxplore.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;NanoXplore&lt;/a&gt;, known for their space rated FPGAs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tool provides developers with a flexible and customizable option for designing for NG-Ultra FPGAs, offering increased reliability through the ability to cross-verify designs using two independent tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Future work could focus on expanding support within nextpnr to cover additional FPGA primitives, such as high-speed I/O blocks and SoC integration making it more useful for high complexity designs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed some recurring issues with &lt;code&gt;verific -lib&lt;/code&gt; mode. You should no longer see errors when the module definitions to be loaded as blackboxes have contents that instantiate other, unknown modules. Also, parameter values on blackbox modules and their instantiations should now be imported correctly into Yosys again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Additional &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys/pull/4678&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;functions for design inspection&lt;/a&gt; have been added to the TCL integration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;code&gt;setenv&lt;/code&gt; command has been added to allow setting environment variables from within yosys scripts. This is useful e.g. to set variables used in file lists before loading them with &lt;code&gt;verific -f xxx.f&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;String attributes are represented more efficiently in the in-memory RTLIL netlist, using a different implementation than bit vector attributes. We have observed reductions in peak memory usage of up to 30% for real world designs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For plugin maintainers, this means some breaking changes if you were directly accessing the &lt;code&gt;bits&lt;/code&gt; member of an &lt;code&gt;RTLIL::Const&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;bits&lt;/code&gt; member has been removed. To access any attribute as a bit vector, use the &lt;code&gt;bits()&lt;/code&gt; method instead, which returns a const iterator. To modify a &lt;code&gt;Const&lt;/code&gt;, you can call &lt;code&gt;std::vector&amp;amp;lt;RTLIL::State&amp;gt;&amp;amp; get_bits()&lt;/code&gt; which forces the implementation to a bit vector. To get the number of bits, use the new &lt;code&gt;Const::size()&lt;/code&gt; method instead of &lt;code&gt;bits.size()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://engineering.ucsc.edu/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Baskin School of Engineering&lt;/a&gt; at UC
Santa Cruz. I did my postdoc in the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/bespoke-silicon-group&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Bespoke Silicon
Group&lt;/a&gt; at the Paul Allen
School of Computer Science at the University of Washington, and earned
my Ph.D. with the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://kastner.ucsd.edu/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Kastner Research Group&lt;/a&gt;
at the University of California, San Diego.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find more about my research and projects on &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.dustinrichmond.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-motivated-you-to-use-the-open-source-tools-in-teaching&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    What motivated you to use the open source tools in teaching?
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve always been curious about reducing barriers in hardware
education. One part of my PhD studied how to make hardware design
easier for non-hardware engineers and laypeople. This is a critical
challenge we’re facing today, as we face a workforce shortage in chip
design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started at UCSC I asked: “What is stopping us from
training more hardware engineers?”. Or alternatively, ”How can we
scale hardware design education?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not a universal opinion, but I personally can’t imagine
teaching hundreds of students per quarter (our goal) with vendor
tools. They’re excellent when you’re an expert, but I like to compare
them to a “Point and Click Adventure Game”. They’re complex! I’m not
saying the vendor tools are bad, they’re just complex to install,
maintain, use, and write tutorials. And when you’re trying to scale
limited teaching resources, that complexity has an opportunity cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Logically, that led to the open source tools. They’re less complex –
and more transparent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;describe-the-class-that-uses-these-tools&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#describe-the-class-that-uses-these-tools&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    Describe the class that uses these tools.
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;The class I teach is the third course in the Computer Engineering
series, and the second in hardware design with Verilog. The first
course focuses purely on logic design with structural Verilog. This
course introduces behavioral Verilog, verification, and some advanced
digital design concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We review structural verilog and then move quickly through always
blocks, memories, Look-up-Tables, DSPs, Synthesis, Place &amp;amp; Route,
Clocking, functional/formal verification. All of the assignments have
some sort of implementation demo on the FPGA we use.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-tools-do-you-use-in-your-class&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    What tools do you use in your class?
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Students use &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.veripool.org/verilator/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Verilator&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/steveicarus/iverilog&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Icarus Verilog&lt;/a&gt; for
simulation, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://yosyshq.net/yosys/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Yosys&lt;/a&gt; for synthesis, and
&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/YosysHQ/nextpnr&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;NextPNR&lt;/a&gt; for Placement, Route and
STA. Students also use
&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://yosyshq.readthedocs.io/projects/sby/en/latest/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Symbiyosys&lt;/a&gt;
for formal verification. Students can also use Verilator for linting –
which I highly encourage. To view waveforms, we use
&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://surfer-project.org/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Surfer&lt;/a&gt;, or
&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://gtkwave.sourceforge.net/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;GTKWave&lt;/a&gt;. To view schematics we use
&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/nturley/netlistsvg&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;netlistsvg&lt;/a&gt; or the dot files
emitted by Yosys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not critical, but to eliminate tool installation overhead and
misconfigurations, this is all distributed in a Dockerfile. The
Dockerfile is ingested by &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/features/codespaces&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;GitHub
Codespaces&lt;/a&gt;, so students can
run the tools in the cloud via VSCode. To view waveforms, we use the
Surfer VSCode Plugin. The end result is an all-in-one interface using
VSCode with zero installation overhead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For implementation, we use the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://1bitsquared.com/products/icebreaker&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Icebreaker
Board&lt;/a&gt; with various PMOD
peripherals (HDMI, I2S2, Joystick, keypad, Seven-Segment, etc). Not a
large board, but we can do streaming audio/video processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I use &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.cocotb.org/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;cocotb&lt;/a&gt; for writing
testbenches that test student code. To parameterize tests, I use
&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/themperek/cocotb-test&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;cocotb-test&lt;/a&gt;. This all
feeds into an autograder, Gradescope, using a library called
&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/ucsb-gradescope-tools/pytest_utils&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;pytest_utils&lt;/a&gt;. We
have an open-source autograder at UCSC that I intend to switch to long
term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-is-the-most-surprising-thing-youve-learned&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-is-the-most-surprising-thing-youve-learned&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    What is the most surprising thing you’ve learned?
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;The open source tools are stable, at least as stable as the vendor
tools. I think this is the most common worry – “If I switch, will it
explode?”. I can confidently say: &lt;strong&gt;No&lt;/strong&gt;. And even better, when they do
explode, you (or a TA) can pretty quickly figure out why. We’ve even
had a colleague push through a Verilator pull request mid-quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-are-some-of-the-benefits-of-switching&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-are-some-of-the-benefits-of-switching&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    What are some of the benefits of switching?
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;verification&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#verification&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    Verification
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;How many people have written a testbench that breaks when they switch
computers? Or versions? Or vendors? The downside of using one tool for
simulation is that it is very easy to write testbenches in Verilog
that are secretly dependent on an internal simulation model. By using
two simulators we can highlight how Verilog is evaluated, and how a
good, tool-agnostic testbench is constructed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the class, students spend two weeks writing testbenches. I give
them working &amp;amp; buggy code that has been synthesized through Yosys
(another benefit). Using testbenches they write, they have to find the
working modules and assemble them into a working design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;speed&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#speed&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    Speed
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It takes less time to Synthesize, Place, and Route a design than it
takes to open some vendor tools. I think this is a critical aspect for
exploration. Waiting 5-minutes just to see a light flash is a
buzzkill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;introspection&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#introspection&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    Introspection
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a pretty universal theme in the tools. Since they’re open
source we can actually see what happens when we simulate, synthesize,
place and route, etc. We can even open the algorithms in class and dissect them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the Lattice FPGAs, it is easier to explain the architecture and
then extrapolate to more complex architectures like Intel and AMD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This introspection extends to visualisation. We use yosys to generate
schematics and view the .dot files, or use netlistsvg. We can do this
at different steps in the flow to see the abstract circuit, and
progressively optimize it. We also do this during lab check-off to
ensure that students are synthesizing to memories instead of arrays of
registers (or something worse).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-are-some-of-the-drawbacks&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-are-some-of-the-drawbacks&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    What are some of the drawbacks?
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;lack-of-legacy&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#lack-of-legacy&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    Lack of Legacy
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vendor tools have 40-odd years of legacy support. There are entire
message boards dedicated to solving issues encountered in every tool
vendor. When you do encounter an issue in the vendor tools, it is
likely many other people have encountered it, if not solved it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is changing, and the open source community is great and strong,
but 40 years is a lot of ground to make up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;student-resistance&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#student-resistance&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    Student Resistance
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Students read job postings, and they want to learn the tools they see
in job postings. Our class is titled “Logic Design with Verilog”, so
we can focus on the language, not the tools. But where do we draw that
line? We’re exploring ideas like using vendor tools in the final weeks
of the quarter, after they’ve learned the language, or pushing vendor
tools to a capstone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an active area of discussion. Vendor tools should be part of a
computer engineering curriculum. How much? And when?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;how-can-the-community-support-you&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#how-can-the-community-support-you&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;

        <guid>http://blog.yosyshq.com/p/tabby-cad-suite-version-20240709-released/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://blog.yosyshq.com/static-2023/YOS_horiz.png" alt="Featured image of post Tabby CAD Suite version 20240709 released!" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The July release of Tabby CAD Suite is now available for download. This month&amp;rsquo;s notable changes mainly affect the build process, so are not relevant if you download our binaries. For those of you subscribing to the YosysHQ Verific Patch and building from source:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have reorganized the build flags for compiling with Verific to try to support more flavors of Verific (more documentation to follow). We have tried to keep existing configurations working, but if you encounter any build issues when updating to the latest release, try a full clean (&lt;code&gt;make clean&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;make clean-abc&lt;/code&gt;) and check if you need to set any of the new &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys/pull/4459&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;ENABLE_VERIFIC_*&lt;/a&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; flags in your &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Makefile.conf&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The minimum supported C++ standard version has been updated to C++17. The compiler flags in the Makefile have been changed to reflect this, but if you are manually setting an older flag, you may need to update your configuration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other YosysHQ news:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The recordings of the FPGA Lightning talks from our last Yosys Users Group meeting are now online! Check them out on &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/@YosysHQ/videos&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

    &gt;Professor Neil Bowles&lt;/a&gt; (Instrument Lead Scientist) and it has
three sensors—&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;TIRI&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
(University of Oxford), &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;MIR&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;, and
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;NIR&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; (VTT Finland)—that will image a
pristine comet to measure its structure, chemical composition, and temperature,
allowing researchers to gain insight into the formation of the Solar system.&lt;/p&gt;

    &gt;Space Instrumentation group&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Oxford is building the
common structures and mechanisms for MIRMIS, building and calibrating the TIRI
sensor, integrating the MIR/NIR sensors, and building MIRMIS&amp;rsquo; command and
data-handling unit (&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;CDHU&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;). The CDHU is the interface to the
spacecraft and is based around a radiation-hard microcontroller and
radiation-tolerant FPGA that together process commands from Earth, control
pointing mirrors to track the target comet, operate the imaging sensors, and
carry out housekeeping over the instrument&amp;rsquo;s multi-year trip through deep space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YosysHQ support FPGA development on MIRMIS by providing formal verification

    &lt;a href=&#34;#why-build-mirmis&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    Why build MIRMIS?
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comets and other interstellar objects can tell us a lot about how our Solar
system formed. As they were often ejected a long time ago, they act as a time
capsule holding the chemicals and materials that were around in the early Solar
system. This means that, if we can accurately measure their properties, we have
a direct view into the past. One challenge with this is finding a &amp;lsquo;pristine&amp;rsquo;
object—we tend to see these objects as they pass through the inner Solar
system, where the heat and radiation from the Sun will change them. MIRMIS will
be launched as part of Comet Interceptor to the Sun–Earth L&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;2&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_point&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Lagrange point&lt;/a&gt;, around 1.5 million kilometres away and where the James Webb
Space Telescope is stationed, so that it can move quickly to intercept a
pristine comet after it&amp;rsquo;s detected but before it&amp;rsquo;s spent too long transiting
the Solar system.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-makes-you-excited-about-mirmis&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    What makes you excited about MIRMIS?
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MIRMIS instrument is exciting both because of the science data it will
produce but also because of the engineering behind it. It continues a process
of refining and improving our equipment—its CDHU and TIRI are evolutions
of Lunar Thermal Mapper, while the infrared filters have heritage to Diviner
and further back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technology behind MIRMIS also has the potential to impact life on Earth
more directly. One use we&amp;rsquo;ve been exploring is launching a MIRMIS-like
instrument to detect wildfires on Earth. The instrument itself is compact
(around the size of a large briefcase), weighs around 9kg, and draws around
11W peak. A small constellation could launch on a single rocket and provide
multiple observations of the entire surface of the Earth per day, and with the
Space Instrumentation group&amp;rsquo;s extensive background in high-resolution infrared
imaging the results could exceed current capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-are-some-of-the-challenges-you-face&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    What are some of the challenges you face?
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;there-are-no-debug-probes-in-space&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#there-are-no-debug-probes-in-space&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    There are no debug probes in space
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Verification and validation are huge parts of building a space instrument. Not
only is deep space a radiation-harsh environment but getting there on a rocket
puts a lot of forces on the relatively delicate glassware in optical systems
and, once you&amp;rsquo;ve launched, there&amp;rsquo;s no replacing a broken part. This is part of
our reason for using Yosys and SymbiYosys in particular—formal
verification of the FPGA components gives us a lot more confidence and
functional coverage than plain unit tests and testbenches can provide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;space-hardware-lags-the-leading-edge&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#space-hardware-lags-the-leading-edge&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    Space hardware lags the leading edge
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It takes a lot of time to qualify a part for space, and for integrated circuits
they often need to be made with different processes from normal commercial
parts. This means that the performance tends to be significantly lower, too.
The FPGA in the MIRMIS CDHU, for example, requires more than a little effort to
close timing at 100MHz and has no niceties like DSP blocks, large block RAMs,
PLLs, high-density logic elements, or extensive IP core libraries. And that&amp;rsquo;s
before having to build in triple redundancy and other safeguards against
radiation flipping a bit in a register or transiently changing the value on a
signal line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m an engineer working across electronics, FPGA, and software disciplines. I
split my time between the Space Instrumentation group at Oxford, as Principal
Engineer currently leading FPGA development on the MIRMIS CDHU, and &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.l3harris.com/en-gb/united-kingdom&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

as a Principal Engineer architecting and helping build high-performance RF and
signal-processing systems. In my work I&amp;rsquo;ve had a hand in projects including
radio direction-finding systems, control systems for ion-trap quantum
computing, GNSS anti-jam/anti-spoof, and both ground and space sides of
satellite payloads, as well as delivering talks and training courses on C++,
software-defined radios, and FPGAs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside of work, I like to take a relaxed approach. I read a lot, I cook and
bake, and occasionally badly play badminton. Being in Oxford, I like to take
advantage of the many green spaces, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to another &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://blog.yosyshq.com/tags/community-spotlight/&#34; &gt;community spotlight&lt;/a&gt; article where we shine a light on open source EDA-related projects.

&lt;p&gt;Manta is a configurable and approachable tool for FPGA debugging and rapid prototyping. It works by letting you configure cores that you instantiate in your FPGA design, and operate from a host machine connected over either UART or Ethernet. These cores can provide a logic analyzer, or direct access to registers or memory on the FPGA. Manta is written in Python, which allows its host-side to code to run on nearly any platform (including the web!). The code on the FPGA side is written in Amaranth HDL which exports to vendor-agnostic Verilog-2001, allowing it to run on nearly any FPGA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a FPGA Engineer working at &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;NASA JPL&lt;/a&gt;, currently working on an orbital interferometer mission called &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://grace.jpl.nasa.gov/news/154/us-germany-partnering-on-mission-to-track-earths-water-movement/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;GRACE-C&lt;/a&gt;. I joined the lab right after getting my Master&amp;rsquo;s degree from EECS from MIT last year, where I helped teach the lab-based &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://fpga.mit.edu/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;FPGA Design Course&lt;/a&gt; and wrote the original version of Manta for my thesis. Oh, and I built the (above) electric shopping cart there too. It&amp;rsquo;s awesome. And kinda dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on Formula cars, quantum computers, robots, and spacecraft, but I have yet to see a field with as much complexity and momentum behind it as the FPGA/SoC/ASIC space. I think there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of work left to do with these devices, and I get a lot of joy from building the tools around them. Manta is one such tool, and I hope you find it useful!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-motivated-you-to-make-manta&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-motivated-you-to-make-manta&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    What motivated you to make Manta?
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we were preparing to teach the FPGA design class at MIT, we noticed that ARM platforms were gaining popularity with students, primarily in the form of Apple Silicon. This was a problem for our EDA tool (Vivado) which, despite our best tricks, was only usable on x86 platforms. To solve this, we developed a tool that ran Vivado remotely, allowing students to build their bitstreams without having the tools installed on their machine. This worked splendidly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this meant that we couldn’t use Vivado’s built-in debugging tools such as the Integrated Logic Analyzer (ILA) or Virtual IO (VIO), as these tools require Vivado’s Hardware Manager to be running on the machine connected to the FPGA. This was a bit of a problem, as students would often connect their FPGAs to external devices for their &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/6-2050-field-programmable-gate-awesomeness/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;final projects&lt;/a&gt;, and it was nearly impossible to guarantee that those were behaving exactly as they were modeled in simulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manta was written to solve this problem. It provides the same functionality that the ILA and VIO cores provide (and more!) without requiring a specific architecture or OS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-makes-you-excited-about-manta&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-makes-you-excited-about-manta&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    What makes you excited about Manta?
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I’ve been developing designs at JPL, hacking on personal projects, and engaging with the community, I’ve been amazed at how long Manta tends to stick inside a project. I thought that it would only be useful at the beginning of a project for getting a quick prototype done, or that it’d only be pulled out to hunt down the occasional bug. However, this hasn’t been the case from what I’ve seen. After it’s been included, it usually tends to stay in the design - either to quickly investigate a bug if it comes up again, or to serve as the permanent link between a FPGA and its host machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This makes me really excited about the need that Manta is fulfilling. But there’s two features that I’m also really excited about:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;waveform-recordplayback&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#waveform-recordplayback&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    Waveform Record/Playback
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manta’s Logic Analyzer allows you to save a captured waveform as a &lt;code&gt;.vcd&lt;/code&gt; file, just like any other logic analyzer. However, unlike any other logic analyzer, it lets you save a captured waveform as a Verilog module. When included in a simulation testbench, this module will generate an exact replication of the captured waveform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is super handy for testing RTL when the exact sequence of inputs it’ll see on the FPGA isn’t well-known. For example, when testing a network stack deployed to a FPGA, I’ve found that some USB-Ethernet adapters aren’t entirely compliant with the RMII spec, and emit slightly malformed packets. This wasn’t modeled in my simulations, but by recording a few malformed packets and playing them in a testbench, I could quickly patch the network stack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is just one example, but it’s been extraordinarily useful for hunting down strange hardware bugs like these!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since Manta can communicate with a host machine over UART, it’s possible to use the Web Serial API to run Manta in the browser, directly from the documentation site:&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here’s a quick demo of an earlier version in action:&lt;/p&gt;

    &gt;
    &lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything here is run locally in your browser, no installation required! Nothing is sent to an external server either. I’m still putting this feature together and it’s not generally available just yet, but I’d love any feedback on it - especially if anyone can think of a proper use case for it. Right now I’m just building this feature to show that it’s possible, but I’m happy to direct development in a more productive direction if one exists.&lt;/p&gt;

    What are some of the challenges you face?
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting the backend of the Web Terminal working was a huge challenge! Inside the Web Terminal Manta is being run in its native Python, which relies on blocking (synchronous) IO between the host and FPGA. Javascript in the browser typically uses non-blocking (asynchronous) IO, so this required some &lt;em&gt;gnarly&lt;/em&gt; tricks to get working. I had never written a line of Javascript prior to this, so getting this working has been extremely satisfying!&lt;/p&gt;

    What could the community do to support you?
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Try Manta and talk about it! If there’s one thing the project needs right now, it’s a community around it. If folks are making cool projects with Manta, then that’ll grow organically. Even just starring the GitHub repo helps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial contributions are also always appreciated and are possible by &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/fischermoseley&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;sponsoring me&lt;/a&gt; on GitHub. Right now I’m looking to purchase some more FPGA development boards to run automated hardware-in-the-loop tests on. If anyone has any Altera, Microchip, ECP5, or Xilinx development boards handy that they’d consider donating, please reach out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, contributions to the source code are extremely welcome. I’m looking to add cores for AXI, AHB3, Wishbone, and Avalon busses, and help contributing to those would be greatly appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

    FazyRV
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to another &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://blog.yosyshq.com/tags/community-spotlight/&#34; &gt;community spotlight&lt;/a&gt; article where we shine a light on open source EDA-related projects. If you want to &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdIEgu6FJZam0-V3PMTjw-eDebJdg_JuIlN4MkLNDr4vs-a5A/viewform?usp=sf_link&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;submit a project, please do so here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FazyRV is a minimal-area RISC-V core that scales with your needs. It allows you to adapt the data path width to process smaller 1, 2, 4, or 8-bit &lt;em&gt;chunks&lt;/em&gt; of the 32-bit operands each clock cycle. In addition, each data path width can be combined with FazyRV&amp;rsquo;s manifold variants to trade area with performance and find the best-fitting configuration for your system requirements and used technology. FazyRV avoids hand optimizations at the gate level to increase readability and ease modifications, such as adding custom instruction extensions.&lt;/p&gt;

		alt=&#34;Meinhard Kissich&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a Ph.D. student at &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.tugraz.at/home&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Graz University of Technology&lt;/a&gt; in Austria. After completing my Master&amp;rsquo;s degree in Information and Computer Engineering in 2022, I joined the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://iti.tugraz.at/eas&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Embedded Architectures &amp;amp; Systems&lt;/a&gt; (EAS) Group as a university assistant. My main interests and research areas are RISC-V architectures, FPGA CAD tools, and applied formal verification. I enjoy realizing unique ideas outside convention and evaluating these implementations. For me, it is not just about gathering knowledge but also about sharing it and contributing back to the community. I lead the Real-Time Operating Systems Laboratory course and am always up for discussions and exciting projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-motivated-you-to-make-fazyrv&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-motivated-you-to-make-fazyrv&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    What motivated you to make FazyRV?
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fascination of getting the most out of a constrained environment and using even small FPGAs for &amp;ldquo;big&amp;rdquo; projects &amp;ndash; it is like the digital design equivalent of &lt;em&gt;Can it run Doom?&lt;/em&gt;. I became captivated by &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/olofk/serv&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;SERV&lt;/a&gt; and how small a system-on-chip design can be. However, there was a gap between the 1-bit bit-serial SERV and prevalent 32-bit cores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That brings me to a second point: I wanted to explore how a sub-32-bit core scales between a 1-bit bit-serial and a 32-bit core in terms of area and performance. This is where FazyRV started as a scalable RISC-V core.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-makes-you-excited-about-fazyrv&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-makes-you-excited-about-fazyrv&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    What makes you excited about FazyRV?
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;FazyRV allows scaling the core to the project&amp;rsquo;s needs in a way that was not available to me before. The fine-grained options can be used to explore the design space and find the best area vs. performance trade-off for the system requirements and target technology. Assume the target technology does not have dual-read-port BRAM primitives available without some area overhead. In this case, you can choose an implementation that serially reads the operands at the expense of one additional clock cycle per instruction. Then, you can synthesize the data path to a width that fits your timing requirements. If it is on edge, you may also experiment with a variant that uses a bypass multiplexer and can save one clock cycle on operand loads. All that is done by just playing around with Verilog parameters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us delve into a practical implementation by plotting the Mandelbrot set. The comparison below illustrates the performance disparity when using different chunk sizes. While the variant with an 8-bit chunk size delivers the highest performance, it also results in the largest design, as depicted in the plot at the top.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there is more to it: FazyRV avoids hand optimization at the gate level. I want to inspect more closely how synthesis tools optimize the current hardware description and map the patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-are-some-of-the-challenges-you-face&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-are-some-of-the-challenges-you-face&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    What are some of the challenges you face?
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;One was undoubtedly the architecture of shift instructions. The considered designs significantly influence the resulting area and performance. Finding a suitable trade-off is more challenging when the area and performance overhead must fit all data path widths without getting out of balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, when designing a core highly optimized for area, there are some sacrifices to be made here and there. Of course, the area must be minimized, but likewise, the core must remain suitable for most users and applications when defining constraints in the feature set. One example is the decoder: Not all instruction bits are explicitly checked to reduce the area. Assumptions are made that some instructions cannot occur. The drawback, however, is that an illegal instruction may be interpreted as a different legal instruction instead of raising an illegal instruction exception. In this particular case, it was handled by providing the decoder logic in a table-like format that can be adapted by the user and synthesized to Verilog code by a tool. It eases modifications to detect illegal instructions when required or to add custom instructions to the core without digging into the decoder at a low level. However, many more decisions in the INT and CSR variants are yet to be made.&lt;/p&gt;

    What could the community do to support you?
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider having a play with FazyRV in your next project, either by using the Verilog design directly or exploring FazyRV via LiteX. We are grateful for any opinions, reported issues, or suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to get involved even more, we maintain a list of open topics in the repository. Feel free to use this as a starting point or bring in your own ideas for discussion or a concrete proposed implementation. Even if you are not involved in digital design, well-designed tooling, workflows, and software support are needed to make adopting FazyRV as convenient as possible and verify changes continuously.&lt;/p&gt;

    Sky130 SPICE, the KiCad way
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Picture this, you&amp;rsquo;re working on a custom layout for &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://skywater-pdk.readthedocs.io/en/main/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Sky130&lt;/a&gt;, be it a PLL, or you&amp;rsquo;re just trying your hands at making some basic building blocks. You&amp;rsquo;ve got a plan, and and ready to start laying down some nets, and that&amp;rsquo;s when you must face it, the dreaded &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://xschem.sourceforge.io/stefan/index.html&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;xschem&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All joking aside, xschem is an incredibly powerful schematic capture system, but that power comes at a cost. xschem is fairly arcane to most, it has some graphical problems, and is just in general really hard to use if you&amp;rsquo;re just starting out which makes rapid iteration difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://kicad.org/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;KiCad&lt;/a&gt;, a robust and Open Source EDA software package, while it is mainly used for PCB layout, we can leverage the schematic capture and built-in SPICE simulation, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;introducing-kicad-pdk-libs&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#introducing-kicad-pdk-libs&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    Introducing kicad-pdk-libs
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A little while ago I ran into &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://twitter.com/lethalbit/status/1498345181359321091&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;that exact problem&lt;/a&gt;, and so I set out and made &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/lethalbit/kicad-pdk-libs&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;kicad-pdk-libs&lt;/a&gt;, a KiCad symbol library that adds schematic symbols for not only the basic building blocks of the Sky130 &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.zerotoasiccourse.com/terminology/pdk/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;PDK&lt;/a&gt;, but also SPICE library linkage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this you can do things as simple as just stubbing out a SPICE simulation for some of the primitive gates, or go down to the transistor level and build gates from scratch and simulate their characteristics!&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it stands, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/lethalbit/kicad-pdk-libs&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;kicad-pdk-libs&lt;/a&gt; has almost 100% complete symbols for both the Sky130A and Sky130B PDKs, all the cell libraries as well as the base &lt;code&gt;sky130_fd_pr&lt;/code&gt; primitives library. This allows you to not just put transistor level schematics together, but much larger schematics using all of the pre-made gates and cells in the library, including some SRAM blocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The basic example that almost everyone uses as their first CMOS device is the trusty inverter. As such we will quickly go over it here, if you wish for a more step-by-step guide with additional details, see the kicad-pdk-libs &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/lethalbit/kicad-pdk-libs/blob/main/docs/intro.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;intro&lt;/a&gt; in the docs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All you need to do is to throw a &lt;code&gt;sky130_pfet_01v8&lt;/code&gt; and a &lt;code&gt;sky130_nfet_01v8&lt;/code&gt; on top of each other with their drains facing each other, hook up &lt;code&gt;VCC&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;GND&lt;/code&gt; and then join the gates and drains, and just like that, you have an inverter using the primitive Sky130 FET models.&lt;/p&gt;

		alt=&#34;The CMOS inverted as described above&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next set up some way to drive the sim, in my case I did a VDC source and then a VPULSE to drive the inverter, these are built-in to the standard KiCad SPICE library, it should look something like this when done:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.yosyshq.com/static-2024/sky130-kicad/schema.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Full view of the KiCad schematic showing the VDC and VPULSE elements along with the CMOS inverter previously shown&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that, you can add the following SPICE directives as a text element on the schematic, and make sure to replace &lt;code&gt;${PDK_ROOT}&lt;/code&gt; with the path to your local PDK root:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-spice&#34; data-lang=&#34;spice&#34;&gt;.tran 100f 100n
.lib ${PDK_ROOT}/sky130A/libs.tech/ngspice/sky130.lib.spice tt
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;And finally, we&amp;rsquo;re ready to run the sim! Open up KiCad&amp;rsquo;s simulation utility and simply click the &amp;ldquo;Run/Stop Simulation&amp;rdquo; button, if all goes well, the simulation will run and then we can plot the &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Y&lt;/code&gt; signals.&lt;/p&gt;

	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;The simulation results of the simple Sky130 CMOS inverter&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look at that! It&amp;rsquo;s a working inverter!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something important to note, this simulation uses default parameters for the Sky130 transistors, you can get more accurate results by using &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://opencircuitdesign.com/magic/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; to extract the transistor parameters from a layout and then attach them to the KiCad symbols by setting the &lt;code&gt;Sim.Params&lt;/code&gt; property on the transistor.&lt;/p&gt;

    Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope this gives you a brief idea of what the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/lethalbit/kicad-pdk-libs&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;kicad-pdk-libs&lt;/a&gt; is all about, and how you can use it to simulate your schematics for use in ASIC layout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it may not be as powerful and scriptable as something like &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://xschem.sourceforge.io/stefan/index.html&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;xschem&lt;/a&gt;, especially right out of the box, I hope it is a useful tool for those just starting out, or for people who just need to throw things together quickly. Especially with the promising improvements coming to KiCad 8&amp;rsquo;s simulation workspace, which will allow much more comprehensive and complete analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

        <pubDate>Tue, 30 Jan 2024 12:00:00 +0200</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://blog.yosyshq.com/p/logic-locking-with-moosic/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://blog.yosyshq.com/static-2024/locking.png" alt="Featured image of post Logic Locking with Moosic" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This guest post is by Gabriel Gouvine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;applying-logic-locking-to-a-tinytapeout-design-with-moosic&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#applying-logic-locking-to-a-tinytapeout-design-with-moosic&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    Applying logic locking to a TinyTapeout design with Moosic
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;When creating a design, most of us are not in possession of the lithography and manufacturing tools necessary to actually create the chip: we send our design to a foundry and they make the chip for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This requires a great deal of trust in the toolchain and the foundry: a malicious actor could introduce backdoors, or just steal the design to reuse it themselves.
For security-conscious designers, countermeasures are necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One such countermeasure is logic locking: we are going to lock our design, so that it does not work without a secret key.
We do it by adding or changing some gates in the design to use the key: if the key is incorrect, the design behaviour will be completely modified.
This is going to make it harder to reuse the design without authorization (you have to find the key) or to introduce backdoors (you have to understand what it does).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.yosyshq.com/static-2024/locking.svg&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;My Image&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We built a Yosys plugin &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/Coloquinte/moosic-yosys-plugin&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;to do just that&lt;/a&gt;.
The plugin provides a &lt;code&gt;logic_locking&lt;/code&gt; command that will mangle the design as much as it can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To illustrate, let&amp;rsquo;s make a design on &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tinytapeout.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;TinyTapeout&lt;/a&gt;, lock it and synthesize it all the way to silicon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-logic-locking&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-is-logic-locking&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    What is logic locking
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal of logic locking is to make the design unusable without the right key.
Usually, we apply it after synthesis, when the design is already mapped to logic gates.
Logic locking adds new gates that will change the behaviour of the design unless the right key is provided.
Our tool does it by adding Xor and Xnor gates, as shown below, but you can imagine a lot of ways to insert or replace gates.
If a 0 is set for a Xor gate, or a 1 for a Xnor gate, the design works as before.
It acts as a countermeasure rather than a cryptographic security.
Much like software countermeasures it will not stop a determined attacker with unlimited resources, but it&amp;rsquo;s one more thing that an attacker will have to break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.yosyshq.com/static-2024/XOR_NXOR_insertion.svg&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Xor insertion&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The logic locking tool needs to decide where to insert the gates.
Its goal is to disrupt the design as much as possible, and ideally make the key hard to guess by running and analyzing the design.
The tool will analyze the impact of inserting a locking gate, and pick the places that maximize its estimated security, typically signals that have a large impact on the design&amp;rsquo;s behaviour.
Ultimately, it&amp;rsquo;s a tradeoff between security and performance: for security, the more gates you insert the better, but this makes the circuit bigger and slower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just a few percents of the gates locked is almost always enough to completely corrupt the design.
We can explore the tradeoff with the plugin.
For example, on this benchmark, locking just 13% of the signals breaks all outputs and all testcases:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;a href=&#34;#locking-a-design&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    Locking a design
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are going to make a toy design to experiment with logic locking. I wrote a counter, that is incremented at each clock cycle where &lt;code&gt;do_incr&lt;/code&gt; is set:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-verilog&#34; data-lang=&#34;verilog&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;module&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;counter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;wire&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;do_incr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;output&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;wire&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mh&#34;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mh&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;data_out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;wire&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;clk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;rst_n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;begin&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;counter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;mh&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;do_incr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;begin&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;counter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;counter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;mh&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;endmodule&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We run Yosys with the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/Coloquinte/moosic-yosys-plugin&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Moosic plugin&lt;/a&gt;. Since logic locking works on a netlist, we first synthesize our counter with the default library:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-tcl&#34; data-lang=&#34;tcl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;read_verilog&lt;/span&gt; src&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;counter.v
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;synth&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now we apply locking and save our netlist. To fit in our 8-bit input port, I picked a small 6-bit key. With only 64 possible values, it is easy to brute-force, so make it a lot bigger if you use it in the wild! And don&amp;rsquo;t lose the key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-tcl&#34; data-lang=&#34;tcl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;logic_locking&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;key-bits &lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;key &lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;39&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;write_verilog&lt;/span&gt; src&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;locked_counter.v
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at the file, our module is now a netlist with an additional port &lt;code&gt;moosic_key&lt;/code&gt;. Following TinyTapeout&amp;rsquo;s philosophy, it all runs as a &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/Coloquinte/locked-tapeout/actions/runs/7582853506/workflow&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Github action&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-verilog&#34; data-lang=&#34;verilog&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;module&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;counter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;do_incr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;data_out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;clk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;rst_n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;moosic_key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;do_incr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;output&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mh&#34;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mh&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;data_out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;clk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;rst_n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mh&#34;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mh&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;moosic_key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;tinytapeout&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#tinytapeout&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    TinyTapeout
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;With TinyTapeout, we can synthesize this design to silicon.
We will have to make a wrapper in order to load the key on our design&amp;hellip; and test that our design works as expected when the key is provided.
The &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/Coloquinte/locked-tapeout/blob/main/src/project.v&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;main project file&lt;/a&gt; will be responsible for loading the key.
We are going to keep it simple and read the key directly from the primary inputs. On a production design, getting the key in would be part of the boot sequence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make sure it all works, we wrote a &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/Coloquinte/locked-tapeout/blob/main/test/test.py&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;testbench&lt;/a&gt; that checks that our counter behaves as expected&amp;hellip; and is indeed broken with the wrong key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally we have the full masks for the design! The code for the TinyTapeout project is available &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/Coloquinte/locked-tapeout&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and our locked counter will be on the TT06 chip when it tapes out.
If you want to go further, have a look at &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/Coloquinte/moosic-yosys-plugin&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;the project page&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://peertube.f-si.org/videos/watch/7f250190-6d8f-4a67-8ed6-d07deda7fba0&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;our Free Silicon Conference presentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For power users, the plugin provides a lot of additional options to pick your security metrics, or to balance security and performance.
Logic locking is an active area of research, and we are happy to provide an open-source tool to apply it to your designs.&lt;/p&gt;

    Surfer
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to another &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://blog.yosyshq.com/tags/community-spotlight/&#34; &gt;community spotlight&lt;/a&gt; article where we shine a light on open source EDA projects. If you want to &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdIEgu6FJZam0-V3PMTjw-eDebJdg_JuIlN4MkLNDr4vs-a5A/viewform?usp=sf_link&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;submit a project, please do so here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surfer is a new waveform viewer with a focus on extensibility and a snappy
(optionally keyboard driven) UI. It runs both natively and in web-assembly, so
you can try it out right here in the browser at
&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://app.surfer-project.org/?load_url=https://app.surfer-project.org/picorv32.vcd&amp;amp;startup_commands=show_quick_start;module_add%20testbench.top&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://app.surfer-project.org&lt;/a&gt;.
The project is written in rust and while it is still in its early stages, it is
usable as a day-to-day wave viewer.&lt;/p&gt;

    Frans Skarman&amp;rsquo;s Bio
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am a 5th year PhD student at the department of electrical engineering at
Linköping university in Sweden. I&amp;rsquo;m originally a software person, who started
off in game development and then descending lower and lower in the tech stack
until I reached this wonderful world of hardware. The whole time, i&amp;rsquo;ve
been most interested in writing tools; initially game engines instead of games,
and now compilers instead of actual hardware design. My main project these days is
&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://spade-lang.org/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://spade-lang.org/&lt;/a&gt; a hardware description language inspired by modern
software languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside of programming I enjoy some 3d printing, playing flight simulators, as
well as sailing or skiing when the weather permits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also need to give credit to Lucas who was featured in the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://blog.yosyshq.com/p/community-spotlight-wal/&#34; &gt;last community
spotlight&lt;/a&gt;, and my PhD advisor Oscar who have
contributed a ton of features and fixes to the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-motivated-you-to-make-surfer&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-motivated-you-to-make-surfer&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    What motivated you to make Surfer?
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;When building my HDL, Spade, I ran into a problem. With a powerful type system,
the bit representation of a signal is often hard to understand, so you need a
way to automatically translate the values back into their human-readable
representation to effectively debug your designs. While &lt;code&gt;gtkwave&lt;/code&gt; has support
for custom translation via external programs, it turned out to be quite hard to
get right and wasn&amp;rsquo;t as powerful as I wanted. For example, I found no way to
translate a value into a list of expandable sub-fields to, for example, expand
individual fields of a struct. I was also bothered by small things like how
zooming and scrolling works in gtkwave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, the question of &amp;ldquo;how hard can it be&amp;rdquo; made me start this project.
Luckily, it turns out that with the right libraries, the answer to that
question was that it is easier than I thought it would be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-makes-you-excited-about-surfer&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-makes-you-excited-about-surfer&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    What makes you excited about Surfer?
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, I&amp;rsquo;m very excited about having a mostly solid waveform viewer where I
and others can try out new things, both in terms of translations and interface.
I do have some favorite features I can touch more on though:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;web-assembly&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#web-assembly&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    Web assembly
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps my favorite thing about Surfer right now is that it works almost
flawlessly in web assembly. You can see a demo of that at
&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://app.surfer-project.org&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://app.surfer-project.org&lt;/a&gt;. If you
have a VCD file to analyse, you can just append that to the URL along with some commands to run when the waveform is loaded, for example
&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://app.surfer-project.org/?load_url=https://app.surfer-project.org/picorv32.vcd&amp;amp;startup_commands=module_add%20testbench;divider_add%20.;divider_add%20top;module_add%20testbench.top;show_quick_start&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://app.surfer-project.org/?load_url=https://app.surfer-project.org/picorv32.vcd&amp;startup_commands=module_add%20testbench;divider_add%20.;divider_add%20top;module_add%20testbench.top;show_quick_start&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from being a cool tech demo, this also enables some cool workflow in
CI/CD. For example, we can augment the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tinytapeout.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;tinytapeout&lt;/a&gt;
test action to link to surfer with the
resulting waveform. No longer will you have to re-run your tests locally, or
manually download a VCD file to view it in a desktop viewer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m also very happy that going from idea to implementation of the web version
took less than a day thanks to the rich rust ecosystem around web assembly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;signal-translation&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#signal-translation&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    Signal translation
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned earlier, a big motivator for building surfer was being able to
get richer translation of Spade types. Even though I had a hacky system for
doing that in &lt;code&gt;gtkwave&lt;/code&gt;, the Surfer version where you can expand or collapse
&lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt;s, view individual &lt;code&gt;enum&lt;/code&gt; variants and translate sub-fields as you please
is a game changer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is an image and a quick demo video showing it off

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another really cool translator is the RISC-V opcode translator shown below&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have also done my best to build this translation system to be decoupled from
Spade, meaning that anyone could add translation for their own HDLs constructs,
or perhaps something completely different, like a translator that splits a stereo audio signal into left and right channels. All that
is needed for that is to implement a &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/surfer-project/surfer/-/blob/main/src/translation/mod.rs?ref_type=heads#L290&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;few methods in a
trait&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    Keyboard and mouse gesture based UI
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a vim user, I hate reaching for my mouse, so we&amp;rsquo;ve put quite a bit of effort
into making surfer usable with just the keyboard. There are some keybindings
for normal navigation of course, but most of the happens via a fuzzy matching
based command palette, similar to ctrl-p in Visual Studio Code. For tasks where
the mouse is more appropriate, like navigating the waveform there is also a mouse gesture based UI. You can see both in action in the video below.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;a href=&#34;#why-do-you-make-open-source-tools&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    Why do you make open source tools?
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every time I have to use non-open source software I get frustrated, sometimes
because dealing with licenses but often just because the software is missing
features or customization options that I want, or because features I rely on get removed in a new version. These frustrations happen less with open source software in my experience. Since I probably wouldn&amp;rsquo;t use a closed
source tool myself, I&amp;rsquo;m certainly not going to build one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For surfer in particular, one of the big advantages of open source is that
everyone can add their favorite features, whether it is a translator for a new
signal format, a new way to render waves or some new way to interact with the
program, things that a closed source developer might not have the interest nor resources to implement.
After a while, this makes an open source tool feel very complete, because all
the small features and fixes have been added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-are-some-challenges&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-are-some-challenges&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    What are some challenges?
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biggest challenge in my mind is in UI design. I&amp;rsquo;m not a UI designer, I only
took a single course on it during my bachelor, so most of the time I&amp;rsquo;m just winging
it. For features I use myself, I at least have some idea of what I want, for
feature requests by others I might even have that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have also been some technical hurdles, primarily because we offload the
parsing of wave files to external libraries. For now we only support VCD, but
we are working on both decoupling surfer from the VCD library, as well as
adding support for other formats, in particular FST.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-could-the-community-do-to-support-you&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    What could the community do to support you?
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, give surfer a try. Let us know what you find nice and what could use
improvements. Especially as a non-UX person it is invaluable to get feedback
from users!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to do more, consider contributing the features you think are
missing. In particular, small features like a translator for a new bit format, a
fix for a small bug you find or perhaps some additional way to zoom or navigate the waveforms.
As I said earlier, people contributing these small things are what gives open source software that
warm feeling that someone has thought of your particular use case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, we&amp;rsquo;re also very happy to accept bigger contributions, like
support for loading files from other wave formats or big translators for
translating to the native format from some alt-HDL like Amaranth, Chisel or
Clash.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;img src="http://blog.yosyshq.com/static-2023/YOS_horiz.png" alt="Featured image of post Tabby CAD Suite version 20231107 released!" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The November release of Tabby CAD Suite is now available for download. Notable changes in this version include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed problems with verific elaboration in VHDL that were introduced in the last release - you should no longer see spurious multiple driver warnings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Memory inference can now recognize (* rom_style = &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; *) attributes on data output and address signals (attributes on the data storage register still take precedence, but this allows forcing a style e.g. when inferring ROM from a case statement).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other YosysHQ news:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We just published a new guest blog post by Theophile Loubiere. He wrote a fun introduction to formal by using SBY to &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://blog.yosyshq.com/p/solving-sudoku-with-sby/&#34; &gt;solve a sudoku&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

    Solving a Sudoku with SBY and Formal Verification
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, I began using SBY to formally verify my designs. You can check out my first attempt on my blog &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://learn-fpga-easily.com/trying-formal-verification-with-symbiyosys-and-chisel/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;learn-fpga-easily&lt;/a&gt;. Formal Verification helps ensure that certain properties of your design always remain true, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bus arbitration&lt;/strong&gt;: &amp;ldquo;Only one master can receive the bus grant at any given time.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overflow and Underflow&lt;/strong&gt;: &amp;ldquo;The FIFO buffer will never overflow or underflow.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;State Machine Reachability&lt;/strong&gt;: &amp;ldquo;The state machine can never transition from state_1 to state_3.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These kinds of properties would normally require an extensive functional testbench for coverage. However, with formal verification and SBY, they can be easily addressed with just a few assertions and assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given my newfound knowledge, it seemed completely natural that after embarrassingly failing to solve a Sudoku puzzle with my grandfather – a hit to my pride – I decided to repurpose the use of SBY just to figure out a Sudoku solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I am excited to share with you my overkill attempt to solve a simple Sudoku puzzle with SBY and Formal Verification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;modeling-the-sudoku&#34;&gt;

    Modeling the Sudoku
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Verilog, we can represent a Sudoku grid straightforwardly: a two-dimensional register encompassing 9 rows and 9 columns, where each cell occupies 4 bits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-verilog&#34; data-lang=&#34;verilog&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;module&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;sudoku&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;	&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;clk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;// Internal 9x9 grid to make operations more intuitive
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;keep&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;reg&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mh&#34;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mh&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;sudoku_grid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mh&#34;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mh&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;][&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mh&#34;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mh&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;no&#34;&gt;`ifdef&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;FORMAL&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;// see next section
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;no&#34;&gt;`endif&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;endmodule&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using the (* keep *) attribute ensures our register won&amp;rsquo;t be discarded during synthesis, even if it isn&amp;rsquo;t used anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;rsquo;s it! Now, let&amp;rsquo;s dive into the interesting part: Formal Verification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-solve-a-sudoku-with-formal-verification-&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#how-to-solve-a-sudoku-with-formal-verification-&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    How to solve a sudoku with Formal Verification ?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Formal verification involves setting specific properties that your design must always satisfy. The formal solver then evaluates a vast array of mathematically choosen scenarios. If a property doesn&amp;rsquo;t always hold true, the solver will tell you: &amp;ldquo;Nope, your property does not hold true in this counter-example.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here&amp;rsquo;s the catch: If we lay down just one property, the solver might churn out a completely irrelevant solution. Take Sudoku: Every row in a correctly solved grid has every digits from 1 to 9. One obvious property is the sum of digits in a row totaling 45 (because 1+2+3+&amp;hellip;+9=45). Yet, with just this, the solver might suggest a row like: 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,45. Clearly flawed, given illegal numbers and the repetition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must assume additional properties to narrow down the solution space and obtain relevant counterproofs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In digital design, we assume valid input behavior, focusing assertions on internal and output signals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For this Sudoku escapade, where we&amp;rsquo;re playfully repurposing the tool, assumptions will lean on the sudoku_grid register (typically a target for assertions).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what assumptions should we make for Sudoku? The basic rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;assuming-the-basic-rules&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#assuming-the-basic-rules&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    Assuming the Basic Rules
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All digits should be between 1 and 9&lt;/strong&gt;. Which translates to:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-verilog&#34; data-lang=&#34;verilog&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;no&#34;&gt;`ifdef&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;FORMAL&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;// variables declaration for all forloops
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;genvar&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;box_row&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;box_col&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;j&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;k&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;// assume all the digits are between 1 and 9

    Using SBY to solve the Grid
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the game rules handed over to our solver, we want it to return the solution now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As highlighted before, in a correctly solved Sudoku, every row, column, or box&amp;rsquo;s digit sum is 45. We simply need to request an example where this property holds true. And since there&amp;rsquo;s only one such example, it elegantly unfolds as our desired Sudoku solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-verilog&#34; data-lang=&#34;verilog&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;// Ask SBY to explicitly cover the (only) case where sum=45s
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;wire&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mh&#34;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mh&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;sum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;assign&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;sum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;sudoku_grid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mh&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;][&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mh&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;lets-run-the-verification&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#lets-run-the-verification&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    Let&amp;rsquo;s run the verification
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To install SBY and all the required formal solvers, I recommend following the straightforward installation process provided by &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/YosysHQ/oss-cad-suite-build&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;oss-cad-suite&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To execute the verification, we&amp;rsquo;ll need our sudoku.v file and a SBY configuration file named sudoku.sby with the content below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;[options]
mode cover

[engines]
smtbmc

[script]
read -formal sudoku.v
prep -top sudoku

[files]
sudoku.v
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;All we have to do is run the following command :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;sby -f sudoku.sby
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;And as you can see&amp;hellip; it fails&amp;hellip; WAIT! WHAT?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.yosyshq.com/static-2023/unreached_cover_statement.png&#34;

		alt=&#34;image&#34;
	
	
&gt;
&lt;em&gt;SBY log&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Unreached cover statement&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; What does that mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The line assumptions are correct.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The row assumptions are correct.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The box assumptions are correct.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The&amp;hellip; line 2 of the initialization is wrong&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;assume(sudoku_grid[1][5]==3); // wrong
assume(sudoku_grid[1][4]==3); // correct
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I visited my grandfather, I handed him the original and copied it onto a paper to solve it myself&amp;hellip; I made a copying error(deep breath)&amp;hellip; At least we stumble upon a unexpected feature : we now know how to identify an unfeasible grid !&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, after correcting my mistake, it works as expected: SBY generates the solution for me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the solution viewed through gtkwave (SBY give you the path of the vcd file):

&gt;
&lt;em&gt;GTKWave screenshot&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hmm&amp;hellip; that&amp;rsquo;s not very user-friendly to interpret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s take the futility of this exercise a step further and craft a Python script to visualize the solution. I&amp;rsquo;ve employed the pyDigitalWaveTools Python library to convert my VCD file into JSON format and have requested ChatGPT to create a script that reads the JSON and displays the solution in my terminal. All the sources can be accessed my &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/LearnFpgaEasily/Solving-Sudoku-with-symbiyosys&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;github page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the moment we&amp;rsquo;ve all been waiting for - the solution:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;9&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;

    Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s wrap this up. First off, if you&amp;rsquo;re ever stuck on that pesky Sudoku during a lazy Sunday afternoon, you now know there’s a&amp;hellip; let&amp;rsquo;s call it an “alternative” way to crack it. And check it is actually feasible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, on the real note: diving into techy stuff using simple problems we already know? It&amp;rsquo;s golden! It’s like trying to learn a new dance step with a song you already love. You get the hang of it faster and, more importantly, it&amp;rsquo;s fun. Playing around with SBY in this wild way just shows how cool and flexible these tools can be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big Thanks to YosysHQ for letting me write on their blog. And to you, dear reader, remember: mix things up, try the unexpected, and most importantly, have some fun while you’re at it. Till next time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to another &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://blog.yosyshq.com/tags/community-spotlight/&#34; &gt;community spotlight&lt;/a&gt; article where we shine a light on open source EDA projects.

&lt;p&gt;Waveform Analysis Language (WAL) is a programming language for complex waveform analysis and EDA tool development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a PhD student at the Institute for Complex Systems at the Johannes Kepler University in Linz, Austria. I received my Master’s degree in computer science from the University of Bremen in Germany. My interests include RISC-V, HW verification and analysis, kayaking, and learning (natural) languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-motivated-you-to-make-wal&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-motivated-you-to-make-wal&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    What motivated you to make WAL?
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Waveforms contain so much interesting information; however, this information is “buried” in enormous amounts of data. Using general purpose languages can quickly become challenging to analyze waveforms because these languages have no concepts of time, design structure, and other things we in hardware care about. With WAL, we want to make it easy to analyze waveforms by integrating those concepts into the language to make it “hardware aware”. Simply speaking, a WAL program runs on your waveform, and you can use the waveform signals just like you use variables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;why-do-you-make-open-source-tools&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#why-do-you-make-open-source-tools&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    Why do you make open source tools?
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a computer scientist coming to the hardware world, it was quite a culture shock when I had to use closed-source toolchains. However, in the last few years, this feeling changed from being shocked to being amazed by all the open-source hardware and EDA projects that emerged.
With WAL, I hope that I can add my small contribution to this change!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-are-some-challenges&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    What are some challenges?
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Handling very large waveforms with WAL is possible, but more work on performance and optimizations is required.
Moreover, the hardware domain requires a bit more work to win people for new ideas than in the software world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tabby CAD Suite now optionally supports floating licenses via FlexLM. Floating licenses are priced at 600€/month (double the price of node-locked licenses). Existing customers may exchange two node-locked licenses for one floating license - please contact us if this would be of interest to you.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The verific command now has a new option -lib to load all modules from the specified files as blackbox modules, disregarding their contents. This is useful especially for loading primitives from a simulation library, e.g.:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;verific -sv -lib cells_sim.v
verific -work unisim -vhdl -lib unisim_VCOMP.vhd
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;The files still need to be parseable by verific, so some limitations remain on the contents of the blackboxed modules, but it is possible to ignore some errors by first calling verific -set-warning VERI-XXXX for the corresponding error code.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Yosys One Liners - Rename</title>
        <link>http://blog.yosyshq.com/p/yosys-one-liners-rename/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 12 Jun 2023 16:52:39 +0200</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://blog.yosyshq.com/p/yosys-one-liners-rename/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://blog.yosyshq.com/static-2023/oneliners.jpeg" alt="Featured image of post Yosys One Liners - Rename" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scenario: you&amp;rsquo;re developing some Verilog RTL and after synthesis the ASIC tools you&amp;rsquo;re using fail on the design! It won&amp;rsquo;t accept square brackets in the input!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the DUT:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;module test(
    input   wire [7:0] a,
    input   wire [7:0] b,
    output  wire [8:0] sum
);

    assign sum = a + b;

endmodule

module gen(
    input   wire [23:0] a,
    input   wire [23:0] b,
    output  wire [26:0] c,
);
    genvar i;
    generate
    for (i=0; i&amp;lt;=2; i=i+1) begin
        test test (
            .a      (a[i*8+:8]),
            .b      (b[i*8+:8]),
            .sum    (c[i*9+:9])
        );
    end
    endgenerate
endmodule
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here we see the square brackets in the output:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;yosys -qp &#39;read_verilog generate.v; prep -top gen; write_verilog out.v&#39;

grep test out.v
    test \genblk1[0].test  (
    test \genblk1[1].test  (
    test \genblk1[2].test  (
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your challenge is to write a yosys one liner that renames the generated module names so they no longer contain square brackets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our solution is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;yosys -p &#39;read_verilog generate.v; prep -top gen; rename -hide */c:*[*; rename -enumerate -pattern bracket_% */c:$auto$rename*; write_verilog out.v&#39;

grep test out.v 
    test bracket_0 (
    test bracket_1 (
    test bracket_2 (
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

    Introduction
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an experimental physicist, I have been working with FPGAs for many years. These versatile devices enable creating customized electronics for all kinds of applications. FPGAs typically contain thousands of mostly simple logic units that can be connected in sophisticated ways using a hardware description language (HDL). I have experience writing efficient software for low-latency embedded processors and have so far only made small adjustments to existing VHDL or Verilog projects. However, only recently have I had the opportunity to take a deeper dive into writing new logic designs from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It does not feel that long ago that FPGA boards were prohibitively expensive devices, and the tools and IP cores were not accessible to everyone. Starting development for FPGAs used to be a costly investment and close to impossible to do on a small budget. Luckily, this situation has changed. Small FPGA chips now sell for as low as $10, and a lot of development is done on free and open-source toolchains. As it turns out, with enough ambition and a bit of courage, one can achieve reasonable results in FPGA-land today without breaking the bank!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;first-find-a-project&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#first-find-a-project&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    First, find a project
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For me, it all started with a new project that involved creating a device capable of measuring arrival time and length of logic signals with sub-nanosecond precision. The idea was to create a low-cost spectrometer for measuring high-intensity gamma radiation and replacing the commonly used ADC (analog-to-digital converter) circuit with a TDC (time-to-digital converter) implemented in an FPGA. So, instead of measuring the amplitude of the signal, only the time the signal spends above a certain threshold (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/603658&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;time-over-threshold&lt;/a&gt;) is measured. This design reduces the system complexity but requires custom logic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;choose-your-tools&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#choose-your-tools&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    Choose your tools
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have seen many projects written in VHDL and Verilog, but for this one, I wanted to try one of the new HDL alternatives. My language of choice happened to be the Python-based &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://amaranth-lang.org/docs/amaranth/latest/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Amaranth HDL&lt;/a&gt; (formerly known as nMigen), primarily because I had in mind to write the accompanying firmware for the device in &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://micropython.org/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;MicroPython&lt;/a&gt;. I was also intrigued by &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://clash-lang.org/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Clash&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/SpinalHDL/SpinalHDL&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;SpinalHDL&lt;/a&gt;, but Amaranth seemed to have an easier learning curve. So, with the clear goal of creating a working TDC, I jumped headfirst into writing Amaranth code. Over the course of the next year (where I spent most of the time on system design and writing software), I became more familiar with the language and successfully finished the project on time for our customer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;set-priorities&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#set-priorities&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    Set priorities
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While I was working on the project, I encountered &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://hdl.github.io/awesome/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;many&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.fpga4fun.com/HDLtutorials.html&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;excellent&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://nandland.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;resources&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/RobertBaruch/nmigen-tutorial&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

    &gt;courses&lt;/a&gt; for FPGA programming and logic design, and I read various code examples in different HDLs. I also questioned whether Amaranth was the right choice or if I should have chosen a more conventional language. One tutorial that particularly captured my attention was &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/BrunoLevy/learn-fpga/blob/master/FemtoRV/TUTORIALS/FROM_BLINKER_TO_RISCV/README.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Bruno Levy&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Blinker to RISC-V&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;. The concept intrigued me; one starts with an innocent and all-too-familiar &amp;lsquo;blinky&amp;rsquo; example but ends up with a fully functional &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RISC-V&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;RISC-V&lt;/a&gt; CPU that can run code written by someone else. Following the tutorial for just 24 steps (the CPU executes the first code after step 7), I was curious to try it out immediately. However, I set it aside during the TDC project and only returned to it afterward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;define-your-goals&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#define-your-goals&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    Define your goals
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At that point, I had enough experience with Amaranth to tackle the tutorial as a practice exercise. Instead of using verilog, I followed Bruno&amp;rsquo;s tutorial in Amaranth HDL, using the open-source &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://f4pga.org/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;F4PGA&lt;/a&gt; (formerly Symbiflow) toolchain and an FPGA board that was not supported in the tutorial (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://digilent.com/reference/programmable-logic/cmod-a7&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Digilent CMOD A7&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.xilinx.com/products/silicon-devices/fpga/artix-7.html&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Xilinx Artix 7&lt;/a&gt;). I wanted to see how far I could go and was unaware of the obstacles that lay ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;a href=&#34;#and-get-going&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    And get going!
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started the course in December 2022 and &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/bl0x/learn-fpga-amaranth&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;published the first version&lt;/a&gt;, including step 18 (mandelbrot generator), by the end of February 2023. Here are some of the things I learned during these three months: even though I had used Amaranth HDL before, I needed to learn a few more tricks to translate the tutorial code. I learned how valuable instant feedback through test benches and simulations can be. Most of the time, if the simulated logic was working correctly, the hardware implementation was doing the right thing. I had long wondered what makes a CPU a CPU: what are the essential parts, and how do they all work together to execute a set of instructions and manipulate memory and/or pixels on the screen?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the question that the tutorial answered in great detail in the first 18 steps and unraveling the mystic black box that a CPU usually is, contributed to at least half the joy I experienced while putting together my own CPU. Bruno explains the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://riscv.org/technical/specifications/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;RISC-V ISA&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-elf-psabi-doc/blob/master/riscv-cc.adoc&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;ABI&lt;/a&gt;, and together we build a more and more capable version of the processor step-by-step. At the same time, I learned the corresponding assembly language for RISC-V, which is essential for testing and programming the CPU at every step. The later steps focus on compiling third-party code with GCC and how to configure the linker so that code is executed from the correct piece of memory in the FPGA. I also learned a lot about compiled objects and ELF formats, which one usually doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about when compiling for Linux-based systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;theres-more-to-it&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#theres-more-to-it&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    There&amp;rsquo;s more to it!
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the obvious takeaways, there were also several unexpected events that occurred along the way. One significant obstacle was that Bruno&amp;rsquo;s tutorial came with a &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/BrunoLevy/learn-fpga/blob/master/FemtoRV/TUTORIALS/FROM_BLINKER_TO_RISCV/riscv_assembly.v&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;custom RISC-V assembler&lt;/a&gt;, written in Verilog, which assembled the instructions while compiling or simulating the logic. This meant that I had to figure out how to seamlessly integrate it with Amaranth. Moreover, I had to fill in jump offsets manually, which is not very convenient. To streamline the process, I went on a longer tangent to implement the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/bl0x/learn-fpga-amaranth/blob/main/tools/riscv_assembler.py&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;assembler in Python&lt;/a&gt;. It was a challenging task, but I succeeded in achieving seamless integration with Amaranth, without the need for manual jump offsets. At a later step, Bruno incorporates the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/olofk/corescore/blob/master/rtl/corescore_emitter_uart.v&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;tiny UART sender&lt;/a&gt; by Olof Kindgren, I successfully ported it to Amaranth as well, which was a pleasant surprise since it almost worked on the first try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, when I attempted to compile for the FPGA boards I had on hand, I realized that they were not supported by the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/amaranth-lang/amaranth-boards&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;amaranth-boards&lt;/a&gt; repository. Fortunately, I was able to modify a similar board description with the help of the reference manual for my hardware (and even get the code merged in time for this post). Meanwhile, I also discovered and fixed a bug in Amaranth itself, as well as some typos in Bruno&amp;rsquo;s tutorial. On more than one occasion I found out that I can effectively discover my own bugs by actually executing code on the CPU. I also learned how to use many great tools, such as &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://yosyshq.net/yosys/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Yosys&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://trabucayre.github.io/openFPGALoader/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;openFPGAloader&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://gtkwave.sourceforge.net/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;GTKWave&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.veripool.org/verilator/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Verilator&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/olofk/edalize&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Edalize&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m currently working through the last parts of Bruno&amp;rsquo;s tutorial, and while I still have a few steps to go, I&amp;rsquo;ve already learned a lot. Converting the examples to Amaranth HDL has been challenging, but not impossible. Personally, I enjoy working with Amaranth because its semantics are clear and it offers the full power of Python when needed. While some things are more verbose in Amaranth (such as Mux() and Repl()) than their Verilog counterparts, others can be written more concisely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;i-could-not-have-done-it-alone&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#i-could-not-have-done-it-alone&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    I could not have done it alone
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the process, I&amp;rsquo;ve had many questions about Amaranth, the build system, the toolchain, and the hardware. Luckily, the helpful community on IRC (#amaranth-lang on libera.chat) and &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/amaranth-lang/amaranth&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; has always been quick to respond. Additionally, documentation for open toolchains and developing with these tools has greatly improved in the past year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, some endurance is needed to pull through, when things don&amp;rsquo;t work as expected. For example, my board and one of my chips were not supported by Amaranth, and I encountered issues compiling on an older laptop with an unsupported 32-bit host architecture. I also found myself in &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/knerd/the-nine-circles-of-python-dependency-hell-481d53e3e025&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;python package hell&lt;/a&gt; on more than one occasion. And as they say, the devil is in the details, since some seemingly small steps have taken considerably more time than anticipated (&amp;ldquo;proceed after you have a working RISC-V assembler&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;we&amp;rsquo;ll use this existing UART module&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;now just convert the ELF to HEX format&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;final-thoughts&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#final-thoughts&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    Final thoughts
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these challenges, my plan is to continue with the tutorial and get the SPI interface working. In the meantime, I&amp;rsquo;m also working on getting support for the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/YosysHQ/apicula&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;free Gowin toolchain&lt;/a&gt; (project apicula) into Amaranth&amp;rsquo;s build system. Looking ahead, I&amp;rsquo;m excited to apply the things I&amp;rsquo;ve learned from (not strictly) following Bruno&amp;rsquo;s tutorial to other projects. I&amp;rsquo;d also encourage anyone interested in these concepts to take their favorite HDL and port the tutorial. For me, this has been a great experience, and I&amp;rsquo;m certain that with a growing user base, FPGA design will become even more accessible than it is today!&lt;/p&gt;

    What was your motivation in making AutoSVA?
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;AutoSVA was build with the goal of making Formal Property Verification (FPV) more accesible for hardware designers. AutoSVA brings a simple language to make annotations in the signal declaration section of a module interface. This enables us to generate FPV testbenches that check that transactions between hardware RTL modules follow their interface specifications. It does not check full correctness of the design but it automatically generate liveness properties (prevent duplicated responses, prevent requests being dropped) and some safety-relate properties of transactions, like data integrity, transaction invariants, uniqueness, stability&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;a href=&#34;#why-do-you-develop-open-source-tools&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    Why do you develop open source tools?
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the title of our paper suggests &amp;ldquo;Democratizing Formal Verification of RTL Module Interactions”
the motivation on making the tool was to make FPV more accesible for hardware designers without much prior knowledge in formal methods.
Thus, open-sourcing makes the most sense when the goal is to get people to use your tool.&lt;/p&gt;

    What are some of the challenges you face?
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hardware RTL projects can be very heterogeneous, I made the language and tool pretty flexible to take any Verilog or SystemVerilog, but I wouldn’t be surprise it the tool complained about some syntax or some include files. The tool also has a way to set inlcude paths on the tool command line, but you never know!&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;img src="http://blog.yosyshq.com/static-2023/oneliners.jpeg" alt="Featured image of post Yosys One Liners - AXI" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AXI spec says &amp;ldquo;On Manager and Subordinate interfaces, there must be no combinatorial paths between input and output signals.&amp;rdquo; If we have a design containing an AXI Manager or Subordinate as netlist (i.e. post &lt;code&gt;proc&lt;/code&gt;) and the AXI ports contain &lt;code&gt;axi_&lt;/code&gt; we can check this automatically using this Yosys one liner:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;flatten; select -assert-none i:*axi_* %coe* o:*axi_* %cie* %i
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that fails we can use &lt;code&gt;show i:*axi_* %coe* o:*axi_* %cie* %i&lt;/code&gt; to then see the combinational path (or using dump/printattrs/select -list instead of show when the design is too large for show).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here &lt;code&gt;i:*axi_* %coe&lt;/code&gt; selects the combinational output cone of all input ports containing &lt;code&gt;axi_&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;o:*axi_* %cie*&lt;/code&gt; selects the combinational input cone of all output ports containing &lt;code&gt;axi_&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;%i&lt;/code&gt; takes the intersection of those two selections, leaving you with only the combinational paths that start and end in such an input/output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also flatten the design, as selecting input/output cones doesn’t work across submodules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to find out more about the Yosys select command, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://yosyshq.readthedocs.io/projects/yosys/en/latest/cmd/select.html&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

        <title>First gateware on the Colorlight 5A-75B board </title>
        <link>http://blog.yosyshq.com/p/colorlight-part-2/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 28 Mar 2023 18:17:00 +0200</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://blog.yosyshq.com/p/colorlight-part-2/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://blog.yosyshq.com/static-2022/colorlight_5a75b.jpg" alt="Featured image of post First gateware on the Colorlight 5A-75B board " /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Welcome to the second part of the Colorlight 5A-75B article. You can find the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://blog.yosyshq.com/p/colorlight-part-1/&#34; &gt;first part here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this blogpost I will show you how to set up, synthesize and program your first Verilog program on the ECP5 FPGA using the Yosys suite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-fpga-toolchain&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#the-fpga-toolchain&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    The FPGA toolchain
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FPGA workflow consists of a few more steps compared to the usual software toolchain workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Verilog source, which is a description of the logic that makes up the FPGA design, first needs to be synthesized.
The synthesis process scans through all the source files and libraries to find out the hierarchy of the modules, starting with the specified top module.
The result of this process is a low level logical representation of all the abstract components that will make up the final design.
In the FPGA flow, this step is done by the &lt;code&gt;yosys&lt;/code&gt; program, and results in a JSON file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step in the toolchain is place-and-route.
This is where the process becomes specific to the target FPGA family, because it takes the abstract components and maps it to physical parts that make up the FPGA.
The logical design is translated into configuration data for all the switches, lookup tables and registers in the FPGA&amp;rsquo;s macroblocks.
Yosys suite includes the Nextpnr tool which does this step.
For our board, which runs on the Lattice ECP5 fpga, we will have to use the &lt;code&gt;nextpnr-ecp5&lt;/code&gt; program.
This will give us a &lt;code&gt;.config&lt;/code&gt; file which represents the configuration of the fpga.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last step is to upload the configuration data to the target FPGA.
This step can have many forms, but in Yosys it has two parts: packing and uploading.
First, the configuration data needs to be packed into a format that is recognized by the FPGA controller.
This is done with the &lt;code&gt;ecppack&lt;/code&gt; executable. We will use &lt;code&gt;ecppack&lt;/code&gt; to create an SVF (Serial Vector Format).
The SVF is a pretty ingenious hack - the file contains plain JTAG commands that need to be sent to the target, which makes it independent from the JTAG adapter.
Using SVF, in principle, you can program any JTAG device with any JTAG adapter.
The second part is the actual upload of the SVF to the device.
We will use &lt;code&gt;openocd&lt;/code&gt; to communicate with our JTAG adapter and upload the SVF file with configuration data to it. After the upload is complete, the FPGA will start running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;hello-blink&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#hello-blink&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    Hello, blink!
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For our journey into getting the board to blink, we will use the following Verilog.
It&amp;rsquo;s a simple clock divisor module whose output is connected to an IO pin on the FPGA that is connected to the onboard LED.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;module top(input clk_i, output led_o);
   reg  led_reg;
   wire baseclk;

   clkdiv #(.DIV(2000000)) slowclk (clk_i, baseclk);

   always @(posedge baseclk) begin;
      led_reg &amp;lt;= !led_reg;
   end

   assign led_o = led_reg;
endmodule


module clkdiv #(parameter DIV = 24&#39;d5000)(
    input wire clk_i,
    output wire clk_o
    );

    reg [24:0] count = 25&#39;b0;
    reg clk_o_internal = 1;
    //on this board we have a 25MHz clock

    always @(posedge clk_i) begin
        count &amp;lt;= count + 25&#39;b1;
        if(count == DIV) begin
            count &amp;lt;= 25&#39;b0;
            clk_o_internal &amp;lt;= ~clk_o_internal;
        end
    end
    assign clk_o = clk_o_internal;
endmodule
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This piece of Verilog will take the clock input from the onboard oscillator, divide it by 500 thousand and output the divided clock to output led_o.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve called the file &lt;code&gt;blink.v&lt;/code&gt;. Now we need to synthesize it using &lt;code&gt;yosys&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;yosys -p &amp;quot;synth_ecp5 -top top -json blink.json&amp;quot; blink.v
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to specify the top module by name using the &lt;code&gt;-top &amp;lt;name&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; option.
Otherwise yosys may pick the wrong module as the top and later cause an error due to unconstrained IOs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step is to assign the logic IOs from the verilog modules to physical pins on the FPGA.
This is necesary for the Place and Route step and is done by a constraints file.
Looking up &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/q3k/chubby75/blob/master/5a-75b/hardware_V8.0.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;q3k&amp;rsquo;s repository&lt;/a&gt; on the 5A-75B board we can find out that the clock is connected to FPGA pin P6, and the onboard led is connected to T6.
Here is how the LPF file looks like. I saved it as blink.lpf:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;LOCATE COMP &amp;quot;clk_i&amp;quot; SITE &amp;quot;P6&amp;quot;;
IOBUF PORT &amp;quot;clk_i&amp;quot; IO_TYPE=LVCMOS33;

LOCATE COMP &amp;quot;led_o&amp;quot; SITE &amp;quot;T6&amp;quot;;
IOBUF PORT &amp;quot;led_o&amp;quot; IO_TYPE=LVCMOS25;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we can run the Place and Route program, &lt;code&gt;nextpnr-ecp5&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;nextpnr-ecp5 --json blink.json --textcfg blink_out.config --25k --package CABGA256 --lpf blink.lpf
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We specify the parameters of the ECP5 FPGA: device type &lt;code&gt;LFE5U-25F&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;--25k&lt;/code&gt;) and the package type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the output config file all we need to do is to pack the bitstream into an SVF file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;ecppack --svf blink.svf blink_out.config blink.bit
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the SVF file it&amp;rsquo;s time to program the bitstream into the FPGA. Connect it to your JTAG adapter and power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;openocd -f colorlight_5a75b.cfg -c &amp;quot;svf -quiet -progress blink.svf; exit&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The file colorlight_5a75b.cfg contains my openocd configuration:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;source [find interface/jlink.cfg]
adapter_khz 500
transport select jtag

jtag newtap ecp5 tap -irlen 8 -expected-id 0x41111043

init
scan_chain
targets

svf -tap ecp5.tap -quiet -progress blink.svf
exit
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the &lt;code&gt;jtag newtap ...&lt;/code&gt; line defines a new Test Access Port that corresponds to the FPGA&amp;rsquo;s TAP. The first line configures openocd to use a JLink as the adapter. If you have a different adapter, then modify this file to your needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The example project, along with a Makefile is &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/polprog/colorlight_hello&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

&lt;p&gt;I received my B.S. in computer science from Carnegie Mellon University in 2019. After graduating, I began working full-time as a software engineer in systematic trading. Since May, I have worked in systematic futures trading at the D. E. Shaw group.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-was-your-motivation-in-making-sv2v&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    What was your motivation in making sv2v?
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;While working as an undergraduate teaching assistant, Professor &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~davide/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Dave Eckhardt&lt;/a&gt; introduced me to an open hardware research group that includes himself and Professor &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~kenmai/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Ken Mai&lt;/a&gt;. Leveraging my prior studies in compilers, I was tasked with developing a tool to convert a RISC-V core written in SystemVerilog to Yosys-compatible Verilog. With help from others on the research team, we accomplished this goal prior to my graduation. Since then, I have continued to develop sv2v on a volunteer basis with the support of CMU and the larger open hardware community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;why-do-you-develop-open-source-tools&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#why-do-you-develop-open-source-tools&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    Why do you develop open source tools?
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;While I enjoy programming projects in general, I find working on open source tools especially rewarding. I appreciate that each improvement can benefit many users. I hope that my contributions can expand the viability of completely free and open source development in a space that is dominated by proprietary tools.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-are-some-of-the-challenges-you-face&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    What are some of the challenges you face?
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have no formal training in electrical engineering or hardware development. Although I have gained experience since starting the project, I still depend on insight and advice from those who actually work on hardware and synthesis flows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SystemVerilog is also a difficult language to work with due to its complexities and ambiguities. Even commercial toolchains vary in terms of feature support, strictness, and behavior. This can make it challenging to decide what language features to implement and how to translate them correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-could-the-community-do-to-support-you&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-could-the-community-do-to-support-you&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    What could the community do to support you?
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am always eager to receive more feedback. It is difficult to gauge interest in features or discover issues without users sharing their thoughts. The feedback I’ve received to date has been essential in making sv2v what it is today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those with experience with functional programming or compilers and an interest in SystemVerilog, there are a number of features and improvements that may be suitable for an outside collaborator. If you’re interested, please reach out!&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;img src="http://blog.yosyshq.com/static-2023/YOS_horiz.png" alt="Featured image of post Tabby CAD Suite version 20230208 released!" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tabby CAD Suite version 20230208 released!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The February release of Tabby CAD Suite is now available for download. Notable changes in this version include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SBY can now use Yosys’s builtin simulation command “sim” to generate counter-example traces. This can be enabled with the “vcd_sim on” option and will become the default in a later release.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using Yosys’s “sim” command, SBY now supports writing traces in gtkwave’s FST format in addition to the VCD format. FST files offer improved handling of signal names containing special characters, native compression and faster load times. This can be enabled with the “fst on” option&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other YosysHQ news:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have a new guest blog post from Victor Suarez Rovere and Juilan Kemmerer about a &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://blog.yosyshq.com/p/3d-raytracing/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;fully open source “C to FPGA” toolchain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;YosysHQ is working with Tillitis in the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://blog.yosyshq.com/p/tillitis-and-yosyshq/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;development of their next FPGA based product&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy February,
The YosysHQ Team&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;img src="http://blog.yosyshq.com/static-2023/tillitis.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Tillitis and YosysHQ" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are happy to announce that we are working with &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tillitis.se/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Tillitis&lt;/a&gt; on their next generation of USB security key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their current model TKey™ is &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/tillitis&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;open source hardware and software&lt;/a&gt;. It uses a Lattice iCE40, chosen due to it being supported by our open source FPGA tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new version includes an upgraded FPGA with more security features. YosysHQ will be working to add support for this FPGA to NextPNR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best news is that the work will be open sourced so you will soon have a new family of FPGAs to experiment with!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;a href=&#34;#3d-raytraced-game-using-fully-open-source-c-to-fpga-toolchain&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    3D raytraced game using fully open source “C to FPGA” toolchain
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sphery vs. Shapes is the world&amp;rsquo;s first 3D raytraced game implemented completely as digital logic. This is all made possible by combining the OSS CAD Suite with CFlexHDL and PipelineC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#summary&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    Summary
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this article we present a tool flow that takes C++ code describing a raytraced game, and produces digital logic that can be implemented in off-the-shelf FPGAs (with no hard or soft CPU used). We aim for these tools to achieve a software friendly C-to-FPGA flow, making the development + simulation process exceptionally fast and easy, while providing high performance and low power hardware results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to project Trellis, Yosys and nextpnr can complete an open source synthesis and place and route flow for ECP5 FPGAs. This was the final piece needed to complete our C-&amp;gt;Bitstream workflow based on fully open source tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8551129/215363908-0625eb6e-a3db-485a-89e2-10267fca6b7c.png&#34;

    &lt;a href=&#34;#fpga-as-a-raytracer&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    FPGA as a raytracer
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interactive ray tracing hardware is novel in FPGA and our work serves as a perfect example that such complex data processing circuits can be developed, tested, and implemented in hardware all from a C language based flow that greatly eases the design process over traditional hardware description languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultra-fast compiled C based emulation and C++ based tools like Verilator allow for fast simulation with realtime debug. This quick workflow is essential, being able to compile-as-C and see the results of code changes executed in realtime is a requirement for developing an interactive game, something not possible with standard FPGA simulators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project generates each video pixel in hard-realtime “chasing the beam”, without a frame buffer and with zero jitter. Medium size Xilinx Artix 7 FPGAs have reached up to 1080p 60FPS (148.5MHz pixel clock). This article describes using an Lattice ECP5 FPGA to reach 480p 60FPS (25MHz pixel clock). Pipelining the entire ray tracer produces a position-to-color latency of a few microseconds at most. 1080p requires about ~400 pipeline stages, 480p requires ~70 stages - in both cases this pipelining is done automatically as part of the tool flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Xilinx Artix 7 FPGA achieves about 70 GFLOP/s using less than 1 watt, thanks to the pipeline with dozens of hardware resources working in parallel. Using that 28nm Xilinx 7 series FPGA, power reduction was calculated to be about 50X less compared with a modern  7nm CPU running heavily vector optimized instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;workflow&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#workflow&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    Workflow
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The workflow allows writing algorithms involving complex types like structures, floating point types and operations on vectors of those, all keeping a clean and familiar syntax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8551129/215365602-9d1493ef-e8f1-444e-b794-b9ba7a898a08.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;image&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The source code is first converted by the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/suarezvictor/CflexHDL&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;CflexHDL&lt;/a&gt; tool from C++ to C. Then this subset of C can be converted to VHDL by &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/JulianKemmerer/PipelineC&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;PipelineC&lt;/a&gt; . GHDL and Yosys are used to convert the output VHDL into netlists that nextpnr can use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to simple conversion to VHDL, PipelineC is primarily the mechanism for producing pipelined digital logic from the pure combinatorial logic derived from C code. PipelineC is aware of the FPGA timing characteristics of the specific device (by iterating with nextpnr) and adds pipelining as needed to meet timing. This avoids the tedious and error-prone task of manual pipelining that digital designers are familiar with. The flow reports a preliminary estimate of resources prior to synthesis and the amount of pipeline stages required to implement the user’s functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To produce a final bitstream GHDL+Yosys are used to generate a flattened single Verilog file version of the design that can easily be incorporated into existing build flows for board specific bitstream support, ex. Litex Orange Crab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, the sources can be compiled and run “as C”, as a kind of  ultra-fast emulation/simulation (the game can be played in FullHD at 60FPS during debug on PC), or the Verilog sources can be processed by Verilator and graphically simulated by another tool we provided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8551129/215365530-4c922851-9ad5-431d-b85e-fa4d94d0a197.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;image&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From inside the PipelineC-Graphics repository there is one command to go from C file to the final bitstream generation and load your FPGA board:  &lt;code&gt;make load&lt;/code&gt;. See additional instructions on github.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;hardware-architecture&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#hardware-architecture&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    Hardware architecture
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project uses a fully open source board based on a Lattice ECP5 FPGA with 85K LUTs (the OrangeCrab board) plus a PMOD-compatible digital video connector for direct connection to a monitor by adapting 3.3V signals to the required CML levels (Machdyne DDMI), they publish schematics as well. For simplicity, only the positive polarity and ground were connected: it works since the differential levels are met, at least on our test setup. The integrated button on the FPGA board is used to play the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8551129/215365509-20f5e573-07dc-49b0-bcbc-73465a991a50.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;image&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This setup allowed 640x480 resolution (25MHz clock) instead of 1920x1080 (148.5MHz clock) as achieved with the original setup using a Xilinx 7 series FPGA device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FPGA design consists of two main blocks: a state machine computing frame-by-frame animation and a long pixel rendering pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8551129/215365576-37c2fbdb-069d-4d61-9b17-71be7b165314.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;image&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To meet 25MHz timing on the Lattice ECP5 FPGA the PipelineC tool created a pixel rendering pipeline of approximately ~70 stages. Below is a visual breakdown of how many stages each major function takes and roughly where/when in the pipeline it occurs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8551129/215365466-eae48ae2-8c27-408c-919a-190692aa10d4.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;image&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above pipeline uses operations on custom floating and fixed point types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;th style=&#34;text-align: left&#34;&gt;Operation&lt;/th&gt;

          &lt;td style=&#34;text-align: left&#34;&gt;Float 3D Vector Normalize&lt;/td&gt;

      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Float types use a 14 bit mantissa instead of the typical 23 bits, and fixed point values are represented with a total of 22 bits: 12 for integer portion, 10 for the fractional bits. Those types are provided by CflexHDL types and the effects of reduced precision can be readily appreciated with the provided graphical simulation tool, so the optimal size is easy to determine by performing the fast simulations.&lt;/p&gt;

    About OSS CAD Suite Integration
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first version of the project used a commercial FPGA board and closed-source synthesis tools. After Project Trellis reverse-engineered the ECP5 device there were only a few minor workarounds that were needed to complete the chain of “everything open source” with Yosys and nextpnr.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of PipelineC’s autopipelining iterations involve synthesizing the design purely as combinatorial logic (pre-pipelining). The share pass that Yosys uses by default for synth_ecp5 does not handle the massive combinatorial network that defines the ray tracer design very well. RAM usage (typically ~8GB max) quickly jumps past the 16GB we had on our workstations. Disabling the share pass required editing the Yosys source code to remove the specific ECP5 run step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second issue we ran into was that in early versions of ECP5 place and route support, nextpnr was not able to pack LUTs+FFs into the shared primitive block as effectively as today. As such, early attempts failed to place and route the design while still having relatively plenty of resources remaining. But after the packing support improved, nextpnr began to produce fully placed and routed designs that could be further iterated on for pipelining. Related: often the nextpnr tool would end up in an infinite loop trying to fix a few remaining overused/unrouted wires - but recent changes seem to have reduced that issue as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the PipelineC tool generates VHDL, we needed to convert the final generated sources to &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/JulianKemmerer/PipelineC-Graphics/blob/main/verilog/top-gsd_orangecrab.v&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;a single&lt;/a&gt; Verilog file  (to be used in Verilator simulation and to generate the bitstream). This is done using the GHDL plugin for Yosys and the Yosys write_verilog command. Occasionally Yosys passes like opt and flatten  were needed during the import process in order to avoid spikes in RAM usage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of these issues were blockers for long. We credit success to the fantastic open source community that provided lots of help in forums and discussions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusions&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#conclusions&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    Conclusions
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We showed a ready-to-use toolchain for hardware design that greatly accelerates development time by using fast simulators at different stages, based on a known programming language syntax. The code can be translated to a logic circuit or run on a off-the-shelf CPU. A example application requiring complex processing was demonstrated by writing a game that implements the usual math operations for raytracing applications, with a clean syntax for math and all the algorithms. Since we apply an automatically calculated -and possibly long- pipeline, the system is capable of performing very well even compared to powerful modern CPUs, but using smaller and embeddable chips, at low power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a Hardware Engineer by profession which is my hobby as well. I enjoy tinkering with FPGAs, Arduinos and building IoT devices to make my life more easy. My interest revolves around making chips and building things with 3D printers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;motivation-to-make-tbengy&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#motivation-to-make-tbengy&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    Motivation to make tbengy:
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have been developing and using small python scripts for personal use. During the pandemic, as we all know many people lost their jobs including engineers from the Semiconductor Industry. In the same time period, I got a chance to tinker with my FPGAs and was working on developing a tool that can help me create a project skeleton as well as scripts to test my design and verify them. When it comes to design compilation, whether it&amp;rsquo;s VHDL, Verilog or Systemverilog we have a lot of open-source as well as commercial tools, problem comes when we want to compile UVM for verification. There isn&amp;rsquo;t much scope for people other than using EDAPlayground or use Commercial tools which are not easily available. Also maintaining projects on EDAPlayground in a structured way is not supported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While updating my Vivado, I read the release notes and found that the Webpack version (free version) now supports complete UVM 1.2 compilation and simulations. This gave me the idea to build a python tool &amp;ldquo;tbengy&amp;rdquo;, which can run on any OS (Windows or Linux) and generates an easily editable and compilable UVM testbench in a structured manner and scripts which will help engineers interested in UVM verification to hone their skills on their machine. I also added support for a Blinky project which generates design, DV and synthesis scripts for all Digilent boards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;why-open-source&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#why-open-source&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    Why open source?
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;I believe in open collaboration. Linux is the best example of what open source can bring to this world and that inspired me to be a part of this community. The Open source tools like MAGIC and OpenROAD which today makes it possible for anyone to design ASICs right from their own machine, this is another motivation for me to give more to this community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-are-the-challenges&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-are-the-challenges&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    What are the challenges?
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being a hardware engineer, software is not my expertise. This became more evident to me when I created string templates in python where after some research I figured there are template libraries like Jinja2, which if used will help a lot in bringing the knowledge of hardware with use of more structured and efficient software in making better tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-could-the-community-do-to-support-you&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-could-the-community-do-to-support-you&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    What could the community do to support you?
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;I found out that it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to get your work reviewed in open source and tapping the right audience. I will be glad if experienced users both from hardware and software domain can review the tool and provide better direction as well as requirements will help in taking the tool to the next level.&lt;/p&gt;

        <pubDate>Mon, 12 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

        <description>&lt;img src="http://blog.yosyshq.com/static-2022/YOS_horiz.png" alt="Featured image of post Tabby CAD Suite version 20221205 released!" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The December release of Tabby CAD Suite is now available for download. Notable changes in this version include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have improved support for SystemVerilog &lt;code&gt;config&lt;/code&gt; elements. You can now have multiple configurations defined, and select which configuration to elaborate with &lt;code&gt;verific -import &amp;lt;configname&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are working on improving the TCL integration in Yosys. There is now an interactive TCL shell mode: use &lt;code&gt;yosys -C&lt;/code&gt; to enter the TCL shell. You can now also use the following command to get the output of a command returned to TCL without the use of an intermediate file: &lt;code&gt;set command_output [yosys tee -s result.string &amp;lt;command&amp;gt;]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;a href=&#34;#introduction&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    Introduction
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re reading this you probably already know that &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Yosys&lt;/a&gt;
is an open source logic synthesis tool. You may also know that it&amp;rsquo;s much more than that: in
my &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tomverbeure.github.io/2020/08/08/CXXRTL-the-New-Yosys-Simulation-Backend.html&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;earlier blog post about CXXRTL&lt;/a&gt;
I call it the &lt;em&gt;swiss army knife of digital logic manipulation&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In most cases, using Yosys
means running pre-made scripts that contain Yosys commands: when I&amp;rsquo;m synthesizing RTL for an FPGA of the
Lattice iCE40 family, the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://yosyshq.readthedocs.io/projects/yosys/en/latest/cmd/synth_ice40.html&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;&lt;code&gt;synth_ice40&lt;/code&gt; command&lt;/a&gt; is
usually sufficient to convert my RTL into a netlist that can be sent straight to
&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/YosysHQ/nextpnr&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;nextpnr&lt;/a&gt;
for place, route, and bitstream creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My current version of Yosys has 232 commands, and many of these commands have an impressive list
of additional options, but sometimes you want to perform very particular logic operations that
don&amp;rsquo;t come standard with the tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this blog post, I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://yosyshq.readthedocs.io/projects/yosys/en/latest/cmd/techmap.html&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;&lt;code&gt;techmap&lt;/code&gt; command&lt;/a&gt;,
a particularly powerful command that allows one to make custom logic transformations by replacing a
logic cell instance of a given type to one or more different ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;mapping-a-multiplication-to-an-fpga-dsp-cell&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#mapping-a-multiplication-to-an-fpga-dsp-cell&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    Mapping a multiplication to an FPGA DSP Cell
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There is a companion &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/tomverbeure/yosys_techmap_blog&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;yosys_techmap_blog project on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;
that contains the Verilog source files and the scripts to generate the graphics and Yosys results
of this blog post.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good example of a &lt;code&gt;techmap&lt;/code&gt; operation is one where a generic multipication
is converted into a DSP block of an FPGA. For those who are unfamiliar with the technology,
FPGAs usually have only a few core logic primitives: lookup-table cells (LUTs) are used to construct
any kind of random logic circuit, RAM cells are, well, RAMs, and DSPs are larger cells that contain one
or more hardware multipliers, often in combination with an accumulator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s look at this Verilog module, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/tomverbeure/yosys_techmap_blog/blob/main/mul.v&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;&lt;code&gt;mul.v&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,
that multiplies two 10-bit values into a 20-bit result:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-verilog&#34; data-lang=&#34;verilog&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;module&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;top&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mh&#34;&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mh&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;op0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mh&#34;&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mh&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;op1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;output&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mh&#34;&gt;19&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mh&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;assign&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;op0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;op1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;endmodule&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When reading in the Verilog file, Yosys translates it into RTLIL (RTL Internal Language),
the internal representation of the design. The multiplication operation becomes a &lt;code&gt;$mul&lt;/code&gt; primitive,
and the whole design looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;module \top
  wire width 10 input 1 \op0
  wire width 10 input 2 \op1
  wire width 20 output 3 \result
  cell $mul $mul$mul.v:3$1
    parameter \A_SIGNED 0
    parameter \A_WIDTH 10
    parameter \B_SIGNED 0
    parameter \B_WIDTH 10
    parameter \Y_WIDTH 20
    connect \A \op0
    connect \B \op1
    connect \Y \result
  end
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yosys has the super useful &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://yosyshq.readthedocs.io/projects/yosys/en/latest/cmd/show.html&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;&lt;code&gt;show&lt;/code&gt; command&lt;/a&gt;
that renders an RTLIL representation as a graph. I usually add the &lt;code&gt;-width -signed&lt;/code&gt; options to
annotate signals with their size and to show which cell ports are signed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.yosyshq.com/static-2022/yosys_techmap/mul_rtlil.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;top module as a graph with $mul instance&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This primitive must be converted into cells of the target technology. Most FPGAs from the
iCE40 family have a handful of DSPs. When you synthesize this module to the iCE40 technology with
&lt;code&gt;synth_ice40 -dsp&lt;/code&gt;, the &lt;code&gt;$mul&lt;/code&gt; primitive gets converted to an &lt;code&gt;SB_MAC16&lt;/code&gt; cell which is the DSP
primitive of the iCE40 family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://blog.yosyshq.com/static-2022/yosys_techmap/SB_MAC16_block_diagram.png&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.yosyshq.com/static-2022/yosys_techmap/SB_MAC16_block_diagram.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;SB_MAC16 internal block diagram&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;SB_MAC16&lt;/code&gt; DSP has a ton of data path and configuration signals, and the multiplier inputs and
output can be up to 16 and 32-bits wide respectively. It&amp;rsquo;s up to a &lt;code&gt;techmap&lt;/code&gt; step to assign all the right
values to the configuration signals, and to correctly tie down unused input data bits or ignore excess
output bits so that the DSP performs the desired 10-bit x 10-bit multiplication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After cleaning up some irrelevant cruft, the post-synthesis RTLIL looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;module \top
  wire width 10 input 1 \op0
  wire width 10 input 2 \op1

&lt;p&gt;All Yosys commands are written in C++, but in the case of &lt;code&gt;techmap&lt;/code&gt; the specific mapping
operations are described in&amp;hellip; Verilog! It&amp;rsquo;s a very neat system that makes it possible for
anyone to create their own custom mapping operations without the need to touch a line of C++.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s see exactly how that works for our example, and look at the source code of the &lt;code&gt;synth_ice40&lt;/code&gt; command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yosys places all the technology-specific operations under the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys/tree/master/techlibs&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;&lt;code&gt;techlibs&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
directory. The code for &lt;code&gt;synth_ice40&lt;/code&gt; can be found in
&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys/blob/master/techlibs/ice40/synth_ice40.cc&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;&lt;code&gt;techlibs/ice40/synth_ice40.cc&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;code&gt;synth_ice40&lt;/code&gt; doesn&amp;rsquo;t really have any smarts by itself: it&amp;rsquo;s a macro command, a series of lower level
Yosys commands strung together into a recipe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you run &lt;code&gt;help synth_ice40&lt;/code&gt; in Yosys, you&amp;rsquo;ll see the following command line option:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;    -dsp
        use iCE40 UltraPlus DSP cells for large arithmetic
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s easy to see &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys/blob/853f4bb3c695d9f5183ef5064ec4cf9cdd8b5300/techlibs/ice40/synth_ice40.cc#L329-L341&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;which steps are activated in the source code&lt;/a&gt; when DSP mapping is enabled:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-c&#34; data-lang=&#34;c&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;run&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;memory_dff&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;no_rw_check_opt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;// ice40_dsp will merge registers, reserve memory port registers first
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;run&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;wreduce t:$mul&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;run&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;techmap -map +/mul2dsp.v -map +/ice40/dsp_map.v -D DSP_A_MAXWIDTH=16 -D DSP_B_MAXWIDTH=16 &amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s quite a bit going on here, but the most interesting command is this one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;    techmap -map +/mul2dsp.v -map +/ice40/dsp_map.v 
        -D DSP_A_MAXWIDTH=16 -D DSP_B_MAXWIDTH=16
        -D DSP_A_MINWIDTH=2 -D DSP_B_MINWIDTH=2 -D DSP_Y_MINWIDTH=11
        -D DSP_NAME=$__MUL16X16
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;What we see here is that &lt;code&gt;techmap&lt;/code&gt; is performing the &lt;code&gt;$mul&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;SB_MAC16&lt;/code&gt; conversion in two steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;convert &lt;code&gt;$mul&lt;/code&gt; to a generic, technology independent DSP multiplier cell.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;convert the generic multiplier DSP cell to an iCE40 DSP cell.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 1: mul2dsp.v&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 1 is done by &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys/blob/master/techlibs/common/mul2dsp.v&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;&lt;code&gt;mul2dsp.v&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
The code is a bit convoluted, but it has the answer as to why there&amp;rsquo;s this intermediate step:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it deals with cases where a single &lt;code&gt;$mul&lt;/code&gt; operation requires more than one DSP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, a 32-bit x 32-bit to 64-bit multiplication is split into 4
16x16=32 multiplications and some additions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it doesn&amp;rsquo;t do the conversion when the inputs of the multiplication are too small&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This avoids wasting precious DSP resources on something that can be implemented with core logic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;-D ...&lt;/code&gt; arguments of the &lt;code&gt;techmap&lt;/code&gt; command specify Verilog defines that are passed to the techmap
file. It&amp;rsquo;s used to parameterize the conversion process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;-D DSP_A_MAXWIDTH=16 -D DSP_B_MAXWIDTH=16&lt;/code&gt; informs &lt;code&gt;mul2dsp&lt;/code&gt; that the maximum input size of
the DSP is 16 bits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;-D DSP_A_MINWIDTH=2 -D DSP_B_MINWIDTH=2 -D DSP_Y_MINWIDTH=11&lt;/code&gt; provides the minimum requirements
that must be satisfied to do the conversion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;-D DSP_NAME=$__MUL16X16&lt;/code&gt; provides the name of the generic multiplier cells that should be created.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can run that first step by ourselves and check the result:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;read_verilog mul.v
clean -purge
techmap -map +/mul2dsp.v -D DSP_A_MAXWIDTH=16 -D DSP_B_MAXWIDTH=16 -D DSP_A_MINWIDTH=2 -D DSP_B_MINWIDTH=2 -D DSP_Y_MINWIDTH=11 -D DSP_NAME=$__MUL16X16
clean -purge
show -width -signed -format png -prefix mul_mul2dsp
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.yosyshq.com/static-2022/yosys_techmap/mul_mul2dsp.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;top module after mul2dsp phase&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you were wondering, here&amp;rsquo;s what this first step looks like for a 20-bit x 20-bit to 40-bit multiplier:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://blog.yosyshq.com/static-2022/yosys_techmap/large_mul_techmap.png&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.yosyshq.com/static-2022/yosys_techmap/large_mul_techmap.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;top module for $mul 20x20=40 after mul2dsp phase&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yosys can often create very long internal labels that stretch the graphical representation, so
I zoomed the image to the part that counts. The 3 red rectangles are the &lt;code&gt;$__MUL16X16&lt;/code&gt; cells that will be converted
to iCE40 DSPs. The blue rectangle is a &lt;code&gt;$__soft_mul&lt;/code&gt; cell that will be converted into random logic
at a large stage, and the 3 green rectangles are &lt;code&gt;$add&lt;/code&gt; cells to bring the results of the different multipliers
together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2: ice40/dsp_map.v&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 2 of the &lt;code&gt;techmap&lt;/code&gt; process, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys/blob/master/techlibs/ice40/dsp_map.v&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;&lt;code&gt;ice40/dsp_map.v&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
is trivial: it converts the generic &lt;code&gt;$__MUL16X16&lt;/code&gt; multiplier cell into an &lt;code&gt;SB_MAC16&lt;/code&gt; cell, wires up the data path inputs and output,
and straps all the other configuration inputs so that the cell is configured as a straight
multiplier.&lt;/p&gt;

    A Horribly Contrived Example Problem
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have a look at the following Verilog example code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sometimes use &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://tomverbeure.github.io/2020/08/08/CXXRTL-the-New-Yosys-Simulation-Backend.html&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;CXXRTL&lt;/a&gt; to simulate my designs.
When I run &lt;code&gt;write_cxxrtl&lt;/code&gt;, the generated file contains the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-c&#34; data-lang=&#34;c&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;bool&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;p_top__unsigned&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;eval&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;	&lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;bool&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;converged&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;	&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;p_sum0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;add_uu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;64&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;p_op0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;p_op1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;	&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;converged&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is exactly as expected, and there&amp;rsquo;s nothing wrong with it. But one thing that bothers me is that CXXRTL
uses 32-bit integer values (&amp;ldquo;chunks&amp;rdquo;) for all its operations. In the code above, there&amp;rsquo;s a 64-bit addition, and
CXXRTL implements those by
&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys/blob/853f4bb3c695d9f5183ef5064ec4cf9cdd8b5300/backends/cxxrtl/cxxrtl.h#L521-L532&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;splitting things up into multiple 32-bit additions&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;                 &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;carry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;      &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;      &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;carry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;   &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a hand-crafted carry-ripple adder. Now, don&amp;rsquo;t worry, things are really not as bad as it seems,
because all the variables that are used for the &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; conditionals and the &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loop are constants. Any
good C++ compiler will optimize the addition above into only a few assembler instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you know your binary adder basics, you see that the addition of a 7-bit and a 6 bit operand will result
at most in an 8-bit result. All higher bits will always be 0. It&amp;rsquo;s overkill to have a 64-bit adder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yosys already has the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://yosyshq.readthedocs.io/projects/yosys/en/latest/cmd/wreduce.html&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;&lt;code&gt;wreduce&lt;/code&gt; command&lt;/a&gt; that reduces logic
operations to just the number of bits that are really needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can see this when we run the following commands:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;read_verilog add.v
hierarchy -top top_unsigned
wreduce
clean -purge
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.yosyshq.com/static-2022/yosys_techmap/add_wreduce.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;top_unsigned after wreduce&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here&amp;rsquo;s the relevant CXXRTL generated code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-c&#34; data-lang=&#34;c&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;bool&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;p_top__unsigned&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;eval&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;bool&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;converged&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;p_sum0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;slice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;add_uu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;p_op0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;p_op1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;p_sum0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;slice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;63&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;56&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;0u&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;0u&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;converged&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;That looks better, but is that really true? The addition returns an 8-bit value, but since
the smallest chunk is 32-bits, the &lt;code&gt;slice&amp;lt;7,0&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; command now requires a read-modify-write
operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I really want is this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-c&#34; data-lang=&#34;c&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;bool&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;p_top__unsigned&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;eval&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;bool&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;converged&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;p_sum0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;slice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;31&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;add_uu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;32&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;p_op0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;p_op1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;32&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;bits&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;p_sum0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;slice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;63&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;32&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;32&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;0u&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;0u&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;		&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;32&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;bits&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;converged&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Yosys doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a command that does this for me, and I really don&amp;rsquo;t
want to modify the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys/blob/master/passes/opt/wreduce.cc&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;C++ code of the &lt;code&gt;wreduce&lt;/code&gt; command&lt;/a&gt;
to make it so.&lt;/p&gt;

    A Custom Techmap Transformation to the Rescue!
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you start Yosys, running &lt;code&gt;help techmap&lt;/code&gt; will give you an exhaustive list of all the features that
you might ever need. But instead of repeating everything in there, let&amp;rsquo;s create an &lt;code&gt;add_reduce&lt;/code&gt; techmap
transformation to solve the problem of the previous section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the basics of a techmap transformation Verilog module:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a techmap transformation only operates on a single design cell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can not use &lt;code&gt;techmap&lt;/code&gt; to perform multi-cell optimizations such mapping a &lt;code&gt;$mul&lt;/code&gt; followed
by an &lt;code&gt;$add&lt;/code&gt; onto an FPGA DSP has multiply-accumulator support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a design cell that is transformed by a techmap is selected by a string that contains a list of cell
types that are specified with the &lt;code&gt;(* techmap_celltype &amp;quot;...&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt; attribute. If the techmap module doesn&amp;rsquo;t have
such an attribute, then it&amp;rsquo;s determined by the name of the Verilog module.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;by default, a techmap operation will iterate on itself until there&amp;rsquo;s nothing left that matches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a techmap operation replaces an &lt;code&gt;$add&lt;/code&gt; primitive by a new &lt;code&gt;$add&lt;/code&gt; primitive, techmap will run again
on the second one. Without some kind of abort mechanism, this will result in an endless loop!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are multiple ways to avoid such an endless loop though. I&amp;rsquo;ll get to that later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it&amp;rsquo;s always a good idea to normalize the configuration on which you want to do the main transformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a good example of what I mean by that: we want to reduce the size of an adder
based on the size of its inputs. But an adder has 2 inputs, and if these inputs have a different
size, then the transformation will have a different code path depending on which input is largest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, an addition is commutative: the order of the inputs doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s easier first do a normalization where the A input is guaranteed to be larger or equal than
the B input by swapping the inputs, so that actual reduction transformation only has to deal with one case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The earlier discussed &lt;code&gt;mul2dsp&lt;/code&gt; techmap module
&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys/blob/master/techlibs/common/mul2dsp.v#L97-L108&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;does the same thing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The add_reduce techmap module declaration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this example, I want a transformation that only works on an &lt;code&gt;$add&lt;/code&gt; instance, so I could
create a techmap Verilog module like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-verilog&#34; data-lang=&#34;verilog&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;module&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;err&#34;&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;$add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I prefer to use a descriptive name for the module and use the &lt;code&gt;(* techmap_celltype ...)&lt;/code&gt; option to select
the cell types on which the module operates:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-verilog&#34; data-lang=&#34;verilog&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;techmap_celltype&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;$add&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;module&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;add_reduce&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The add_reduce techmap module interface&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The techmap module interface should be the same as the cell on which it operates. Both the
input/output signals and the parameters must be the same. Yosys has a Verilog file called
&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys/blob/master/techlibs/common/simlib.v&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;&lt;code&gt;simlib.v&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that
contains the reference simulation modules of all its internal primitives. You can use
this to check out the interface details of particular primitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys/blob/master/techlibs/common/simlib.v#L834-L844&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;the one for the &lt;code&gt;$add&lt;/code&gt; primitive&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-verilog&#34; data-lang=&#34;verilog&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;module&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;err&#34;&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;$add&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;parameter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;A_SIGNED&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;mh&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;parameter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;B_SIGNED&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;mh&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;parameter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;A_WIDTH&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;mh&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;parameter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;B_WIDTH&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;mh&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;parameter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Y_WIDTH&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;mh&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;A_WIDTH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mh&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mh&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;B_WIDTH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mh&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mh&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;output&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Y_WIDTH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mh&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mh&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;add_reduce&lt;/code&gt; techmap module has the same interface:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-verilog&#34; data-lang=&#34;verilog&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;techmap_celltype&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;$add&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;module&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;add_reduce&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;	&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;parameter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;A_SIGNED&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;mh&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;	&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;parameter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;A_WIDTH&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;mh&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;	&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;B_WIDTH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mh&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mh&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;	&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;force_downto&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;	&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;output&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Y_WIDTH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mh&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mh&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;force_downto&lt;/code&gt; attribute ensures that the highest numbered bit of each signal is
the MSB. When this attribute is present, Yosys will automatically swap around the bits of connected
wires so that you don&amp;rsquo;t need to worry about wackos who use bit 0 as MSB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;add_reduce stop conditions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we&amp;rsquo;re replacing an &lt;code&gt;$add&lt;/code&gt; primitive with another &lt;code&gt;$add&lt;/code&gt; primitive, we need to make sure that
there are special conditions to prevent the &lt;code&gt;techmap&lt;/code&gt; operation to run forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can tell the &lt;code&gt;techmap&lt;/code&gt; command to stop transforming the current cell instance
by assigning a non-zero value to the &lt;code&gt;_TECHMAP_FAIL_&lt;/code&gt; wire:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-verilog&#34; data-lang=&#34;verilog&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;wire&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;_TECHMAP_FAIL_&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;mh&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;    
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this operation, we want stop transforming an &lt;code&gt;$add&lt;/code&gt; primitive for a number of conditions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;when the size of the adder is already equal or smaller than the minimal desired adder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can set the minimum size with the `Y_MIN_WIDTH define.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the size of the adder can&amp;rsquo;t be reduced because it would change the result of the calculation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it&amp;rsquo;s a signed addition and we only want to transform unsigned additions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The `REDUCE_SIGNED define must be set to allow signed adder transformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This translates into the following code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-verilog&#34; data-lang=&#34;verilog&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;localparam&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;SIGNED_ADDER&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;A_SIGNED&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;mh&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;B_SIGNED&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;mh&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;generate&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Y_WIDTH&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;no&#34;&gt;`Y_MIN_WIDTH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;begin&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;            &lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;wire&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;_TECHMAP_FAIL_&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;mh&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;    
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Y_WIDTH&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;A_WIDTH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mh&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;begin&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;            &lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;wire&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;_TECHMAP_FAIL_&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;mh&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;    
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;SIGNED_ADDER&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;no&#34;&gt;`REDUCE_SIGNED&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;begin&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;            &lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;wire&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;_TECHMAP_FAIL_&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;mh&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;    
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are other ways to prevent &lt;code&gt;techmap&lt;/code&gt; to run forever.  For example, in the &lt;code&gt;mul2dsp.v&lt;/code&gt; code,
a &lt;code&gt;$__soft_mul&lt;/code&gt; cell used instead of a &lt;code&gt;$mul&lt;/code&gt; primitive. Yosys has no such primitive, but
in a later step, after &lt;code&gt;techmap&lt;/code&gt; has been completed, this &lt;code&gt;$__soft_mul&lt;/code&gt; cell is converted
back to a &lt;code&gt;$mul$&lt;/code&gt; cell:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;chtype -set $mul t:$__soft_mul
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;add_reduce normalization&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The normalization code of &lt;code&gt;add_reduce&lt;/code&gt; is pretty much a straight copy of the one
from &lt;code&gt;mul2dsp&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-verilog&#34; data-lang=&#34;verilog&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;generate&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;	&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;	&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;B_WIDTH&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;A_WIDTH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;begin&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;            &lt;span class=&#34;err&#34;&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;$add&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;#(&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;                &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;A_SIGNED&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;B_SIGNED&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;B&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;are&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;swapped&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;                &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;B_SIGNED&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;A_SIGNED&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;                &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;A_WIDTH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;B_WIDTH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;                &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;B_WIDTH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;A_WIDTH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;                &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Y_WIDTH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Y_WIDTH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;            &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;_TECHMAP_REPLACE_&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;                &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;               &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;                &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;               &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;                &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;            &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;	&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;	&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When using &lt;code&gt;_TECHMAP_REPLACE_&lt;/code&gt; as instance name of the swapped &lt;code&gt;$add&lt;/code&gt; primitive, it
will inherit the instance name of the original instance. This is one of the
many predefined variables that are explained by running &lt;code&gt;help techmap&lt;/code&gt; in Yosys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we replace &lt;code&gt;$add&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;$add&lt;/code&gt;, running &lt;code&gt;techmap&lt;/code&gt; will result in the
&lt;code&gt;$add&lt;/code&gt; cell being transformed twice times if B is larger than A: the first time
to swap the inputs, and the second time for the actual reduction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If &lt;code&gt;techmap&lt;/code&gt; needs to transform the same cell multiple times, it can
be hard to debug. You can use the &lt;code&gt;-max_iter &amp;lt;number&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; option to limit
the number of transformations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, here&amp;rsquo;s what the design originally looked like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.yosyshq.com/static-2022/yosys_techmap/add_orig.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;top_unsigned original version&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here&amp;rsquo;s how things look when stopping the &lt;code&gt;add_reduce&lt;/code&gt; operation after the
first iteration:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;techmap -map add_reduce.v -max_iter 1
clean -purge
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.yosyshq.com/static-2022/yosys_techmap/add_swap_clean.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;top_unsigned after swapping inputs&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;op1&lt;/code&gt; with the largest input size of 7 is now connected to A!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The actual add_reduce transformation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that all preliminary formalities are behind use, the actual reduction
code is pretty straightfoward:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-verilog&#34; data-lang=&#34;verilog&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;begin&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;localparam&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;ADDER_WIDTH&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;no&#34;&gt;`MAX&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;no&#34;&gt;`Y_MIN_WIDTH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;A_WIDTH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mh&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;err&#34;&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;$add&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;#(&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;A_SIGNED&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;A_SIGNED&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final &lt;code&gt;add_reduce.v&lt;/code&gt; code can be found &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/tomverbeure/yosys_techmap_blog/blob/main/add_reduce.v&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
We can run the whole thing with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;techmap -map add_reduce.v -D Y_MIN_WIDTH=32
clean -purge
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result is exactly what we wanted, as shown in the graphical diagram&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h1 id=&#34;formal-equivalence-check&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#formal-equivalence-check&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    Formal Equivalence Check
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whenever you do logic transformations, it&amp;rsquo;s not a bad idea to check that the pre- and
post-transformation logic behaves exactly the same. Yosys has a basic built-in equivalence
checker. It&amp;rsquo;s not a performance monster, but it&amp;rsquo;s good enough for this kind of use case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the example below, I&amp;rsquo;m verifying the &lt;code&gt;add_reduce&lt;/code&gt; techmap on a design with an adder that
has an output that&amp;rsquo;s 10 instead of 64 bits, and the minimum size is set to 8.
This makes the size of the graphs more managable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Load the original design
read_verilog add.v
hierarchy -top top_unsigned10
rename top_unsigned10 top_unsigned

# Make a golden reference copy of the unmodified design
copy top_unsigned top_unsigned_gold

# Select the original version to do the techmap
select top_unsigned

# Do the techmap on top_unsigned
techmap -map add_reduce.v -D Y_MIN_WIDTH=8 
clean -purge
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, so good: Yosys now has 2 designs. &lt;code&gt;top_unsigned_gold&lt;/code&gt; is the original one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.yosyshq.com/static-2022/yosys_techmap/add10_gold.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;top_unsigned10 golden&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And &lt;code&gt;top_unsigned&lt;/code&gt; has been transformed with the techmap:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.yosyshq.com/static-2022/yosys_techmap/add10_reduce.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;top_unsigned10 reduce&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s compare them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;equiv_make top_unsigned_gold top_unsigned top_equiv
select top_equiv
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;equiv_make&lt;/code&gt; has the golden and the transformed design as input and creates a new
design with &lt;code&gt;$equiv&lt;/code&gt; primitive cells inserted at the output of both designs. These cells
will tell the equivalence checker which nets to check for formal equivalence. The
new design &lt;code&gt;top_equiv&lt;/code&gt; looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://blog.yosyshq.com/static-2022/yosys_techmap/add10_equiv_make.png&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.yosyshq.com/static-2022/yosys_techmap/add10_equiv_make.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;top_unsigned10 equiv_make&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;em&gt;(Click to enlarge)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the new design has both the golden and the transformed logic on the left,
driven by the same inputs. For there are 10 &lt;code&gt;$equiv&lt;/code&gt; cells, one for each bit of the output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can now run the equivalence check:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;equiv_simple
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll see something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;8. Executing EQUIV_SIMPLE pass.
Found 10 unproven $equiv cells (1 groups) in top_equiv:
 Grouping SAT models for \sum0:
  Trying to prove $equiv for \sum0 [0]: success!
  Trying to prove $equiv for \sum0 [1]: success!
  Trying to prove $equiv for \sum0 [2]: success!
  Trying to prove $equiv for \sum0 [3]: success!
  Trying to prove $equiv for \sum0 [4]: success!
  Trying to prove $equiv for \sum0 [5]: success!
  Trying to prove $equiv for \sum0 [6]: success!
  Trying to prove $equiv for \sum0 [7]: success!
  Trying to prove $equiv for \sum0 [8]: success!
  Trying to prove $equiv for \sum0 [9]: success!
Proved 10 previously unproven $equiv cells.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each individual bit has been proven to be correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can make Yosys fail if there were any unproven &lt;code&gt;$equiv&lt;/code&gt; cells, like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;equiv_status -assert
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, in our case, all is well:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;9. Executing EQUIV_STATUS pass.
Found 10 $equiv cells in top_equiv:
  Of those cells 10 are proven and 0 are unproven.
  Equivalence successfully proven!
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve now proven that our &lt;code&gt;add_reduce&lt;/code&gt; techmap is correct, but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean
it&amp;rsquo;s guaranteed bug free: we&amp;rsquo;ve only tested one combination of input and output
signal sizes. To be absolutely sure, you&amp;rsquo;d need more variety of test cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is only a quick example of what Yosys can do, there&amp;rsquo;s a variety of additional
equivalence and logic proof features, most of which I don&amp;rsquo;t know much about! You
could start by checking out the help information for the &lt;code&gt;equiv_*&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;miter&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;sat&lt;/code&gt;
commands to learn more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;cleaning-up&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#cleaning-up&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    Cleaning Up
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Yosys creates new cells and reconnects wires, it won&amp;rsquo;t immediately delete older cells and wires
that aren&amp;rsquo;t used anymore. You need to expliclity tell Yosys to do so with the &lt;code&gt;clean -purge&lt;/code&gt;
command that you can see in some of the command sequences above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s what the reduced adder looks like without first running a clean:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.yosyshq.com/static-2022/yosys_techmap/add_reduce_unclean.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;top_unsigned after custom reduce without clean&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s why you see a &lt;code&gt;clean -purge&lt;/code&gt; statement all over the place
&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/tomverbeure/yosys_techmap_blog/blob/main/add_reduce.yosys&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;in the script&lt;/a&gt;
generates all the pretty pictures of this blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#conclusion&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    Conclusion
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Techmap is a very nice tool to have to transform single cells into something that better maps to
your chosen target. The example that I&amp;rsquo;ve given here is a bit dumb (I&amp;rsquo;m not even sure if it would
actually result in better compiled CXXRTL code!), but it shows some of the potential of what
can be achieved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have only scratched the surface of what can be done with it: there are ways to make a &lt;code&gt;techmap&lt;/code&gt;
module behave differently based on whether or not certain input bits are constant, you can
instruct Yosys to run another  Yosys command after performing a &lt;code&gt;techmap&lt;/code&gt; iteration, and
so forth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to go deeper, you should definitely start by checking out the help instructions, not
only of &lt;code&gt;techmap&lt;/code&gt; command, but also some of the other ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The read and verific commands now support here-documents in scripts, the same way as read_verilog. This is useful e.g. to have small self-contained tests in a single file such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;read -sv &amp;lt;&amp;lt;EOT
module top(input clk, output reg [1:0] q);
    wire [1:0] x = 2&#39;b10;
    always @(posedge clk)
        q &amp;lt;= x &amp;amp; 2&#39;b11;
endmodule
EOT
prep -top top
sim -clock clk -n 1 -w top
select -assert-count 1 a:init=2&#39;b10 top/q %i

        <title>Introducing the Colorlight 5A-75B board</title>
        <link>http://blog.yosyshq.com/p/colorlight-part-1/</link>
        <pubDate>Sun, 16 Oct 2022 18:17:00 +0200</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://blog.yosyshq.com/p/colorlight-part-1/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://blog.yosyshq.com/static-2022/colorlight_5a75b.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Introducing the Colorlight 5A-75B board" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This guest post is the first in a two part series by Chris Lasocki.
Part 2 is &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://blog.yosyshq.com/p/colorlight-part-2/&#34; &gt;now available here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that it was an accident - a generic part of a LED display has
become a low cost FPGA development board. The board in question is the
Colorlight 5A-75B, which is a so-called receiver card. Featuring a
Lattice ECP5 FPGA, supported by Yosys, it allows you to leverage a
fully open-source FPGA development toolchain. Priced on average at
20-25 USD, it is a very accessible board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Colorlight 5A-75B was originally a part of a modular LED display
standard. It&amp;rsquo;s a receiver card, which means that it sits between the
computer controlling the show, and the LED panels themselves. It fulfills a
basic but crucial task of receiving the video signal and driving the
RGB panels accordingly. This takes a lot of bandwidth, so it is
equipped with a moderately fast ECP5 LFE5U25-F FPGA and two Gigabit
Ethernet interfaces. There is also a 16Mbit SDRAM for temporary
storage and a Flash memory of the same size for storing the
bitstream. It features 8 output ports of a known pinout (HUB75) and 5V
outputs. The board has caught attention of hardware hackers and
soon after was fully &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/q3k/chubby75&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;reverse
engineered&lt;/a&gt; by q3k and others. A
schematic with pinouts is available, as well as other
documentation. A great amount of work has been done here and this is
what enables the Colorlight board to be used in the hacker spirit way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accidentally, this board design happens to be a great compromise
between feature-rich and IO-rich. The only on-board peripherals are the
basic or high speed ones, which would be hard to connect over the 0.1&amp;quot;
pin headers. It is also the only development board with a dual Gigabit
Ethernet interface in its price range. Since it&amp;rsquo;s just an FPGA, the
16MBit SDRAM should be enough for most applications, while being easy
to implement a controller for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;hacking-the-board&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#hacking-the-board&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    Hacking the board
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the on-board JTAG port, you just need to solder on
a 4 pin header and you are ready to upload your own bitstreams to the
ECP5 FPGA. This FPGA is fully supported by the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/YosysHQ/oss-cad-suite-build&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Yosys toolchain&lt;/a&gt;, from
the verilog compiler through place and route engine to the bitstream
generator, and along with an open source JTAG adapter like the Bus
Pirate (or anything else, really) it only takes a moment to send the
bitstream down and see your code run. There is a
great deal of user accessible IO broken out on the HUB75 headers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FPGA has a 25MHz clock directed to it, as well as one onboard LED
and a button, which is plenty enough for a Verilog &amp;ldquo;Hello, world!&amp;rdquo;
project - blinking the LED.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only downside of this board is lack of inputs by default - You
need to replace the 74HC245 output drivers with bidirectional level
shifters. However there exists a pin compatible level shifter IC,
SN74CBT3245A which can replace the default output driver providing 3v3
bidirectional IO. Other options, such as fabricating tiny PCBs that
replace the shifters with wires, or connecting the direction pin of the
output drivers to an IO pin are also a possibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#summary&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    Summary
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Colorlight 5A-75B is a good choice for those who want to try
open-source FPGA programming but do not wish to spend a significant
amount of money for a classic development board. The on-board
peripherals are enough for a first project to get acquainted with the
toolchain. Gigabit Ethernet and SDRAM could also come in handy in
future more advanced projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next post I will describe how to write, compile and upload a
Verilog project that will blink the onboard led of the 5A-75B board.&lt;/p&gt;

    SBY
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SBY now runs multiple tasks in parallel. Additionally it now limits the number of concurrently running subprocesses to the available number of cores. The &amp;ndash;sequential command line option allows you to opt out of running tasks in parallel and the -j N option sets the limit of concurrent subprocesses to N instead of the default. All this is optionally integrated with the make jobserver protocol to enforce the concurrent process limit across other processes launched by make.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a new SBY option vcd to enable or disable the generation of VCD traces. It defaults to on, but can be set to off when no traces are required to save runtime and disk space. VCD trace generation performance for the smtbmc engine is also improved in this release, so we recommend re-evaluating the performance before turning VCD trace generation off.&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>Autotune</title>
        <link>http://blog.yosyshq.com/p/sby-autotune/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 27 Jul 2022 14:41:35 +0200</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://blog.yosyshq.com/p/sby-autotune/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://blog.yosyshq.com/static-2022/autotune.png" alt="Featured image of post Autotune" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sby, our frontend for formal verification, makes it easy to use Yosys with the various open source verification tools that are included in our CAD suites. Sby integrates these tools as engines and provides a unified interface. Additionally, many of the verification tools internally use lower-level tools like SAT and SMT solvers and allow the user to select between different supported solvers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most verification tasks can be performed by several of the supported engines and solvers. Depending on the specific verification task at hand, there can be large performance differences between them. Thus, it makes sense to try several engines and solvers to pick the best performing one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Sby, switching the engine or solver only requires changing a single line in the “[engines]” section of the .sby file. Still, the large number of engine and solver configurations made it impractical to manually try all of them for every verification task, so it was easy to leave performance on the table by sticking with a worse performing configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help you get the best performance out of Sby, we now introduced the &amp;ndash;autotune option. If you add this option to your usual Sby invocation, it will go ahead and automatically try all recommended engine and solver combinations, producing a report that lists the best performing configurations. You can then copy a configuration from this report into your .sby file to use a faster engine for future sby invocations. From time to time, when updating the CAD suite, or making significant changes to your design, you can run autotune again to see if you are still using the best performing engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sby  &amp;ndash;autotune is also a lot smarter than just trying every configuration in sequence. It runs in parallel and knows how to use timeouts and retries so that a single slow engine that would take hours doesn’t keep Sby from quickly discovering a better configuration that finishes in seconds. When selecting the recommended engines and solvers, it also takes into account the design and settings in your .sby file to avoid known incompatibilities or performance issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More details on how to use and configure the automatic engine selection can be found in the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://symbiyosys.readthedocs.io/en/latest/autotune.html&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;corresponding section of the Sby documentation&lt;/a&gt;. If you want to try out the new autotune feature yourself, but don’t have a suitable Sby project at hand, you can try it on the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/YosysHQ/sby/tree/master/docs/examples/autotune&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;small example project we prepared&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Formal Tristate Support</title>
        <link>http://blog.yosyshq.com/p/formal-trisate-support/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 17 Jun 2022 17:28:17 +0200</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://blog.yosyshq.com/p/formal-trisate-support/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://blog.yosyshq.com/static-2022/tristate.png" alt="Featured image of post Formal Tristate Support" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sby, our formal verification tool has recently got better support for tristate circuits. A tristate output is one that can either drive the connected wire to a high or low logic level or be in a high impedance state where it does not drive the output. This allows directly connecting multiple tristate outputs as long as no two are driving the output simultaneously. With tribuf (tristate buffer) support turned on, sby will automatically create assertions for any tristate signals that can be driven via multiples outputs. If more than one tristate output can drive the same wire, such an  assertion will fail. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;module module1 (input wire active, output wire tri_out);
    assign tri_out = active ? 1&#39;b0 : 1&#39;bz;
endmodule

module module2 (input wire active, output wire tri_out);
    assign tri_out = active ? 1&#39;b0 : 1&#39;bz;
endmodule

module top_fail (input wire clk, input wire active1, input wire active2, output wire out);
    module1 module1 (.active(active1), .tri_out(out));
    module2 module2 (.active(active2), .tri_out(out));
endmodule
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And an .sby file with a script section that includes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;prep -top top_fail
flatten; tribuf -formal
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will fail with a message like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Assert failed in top: tristates.v:3 ($tribuf_conflict$$flatten/module1.$verific$i6$tristates.v:3$9)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By ensuring that only one tristate module is active at once, for example&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;module top_pass (input wire clk, input wire active1, output wire out);
    module1 module1 (.active(active1), .tri_out(out));
    module2 module2 (.active(!active1), .tri_out(out));
endmodule
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sby will now finish with no errors. There is no need to add any assertion to the design, with the tribuf -formal command enabled in the [script] section of the sby file, the assertions are added automatically. Note that the flatten command is required when any module outputs can be tristate and that it has to precede the tribuf -formal command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can try the example out here: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/YosysHQ/sby/tree/master/docs/examples/tristate&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://github.com/YosysHQ/sby/tree/master/docs/examples/tristate&lt;/a&gt;
The sby file makes use of 2 different task sections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently used this feature to prove the safety of the tristate bus for an ASIC design. The ASIC combines 13 smaller projects with 45 verilog files. Sby completes a full proof with a depth of 5 clock cycles in 10 seconds. You can take a look at the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/mattvenn/zero_to_asic_MPW6&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;project&amp;rsquo;s repository&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/mattvenn/zero_to_asic_mpw6/blob/mpw6/tribuf.sby&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;.sby file&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This shows that verifying meaningful properties of a larger design doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to take hours or even days. The time required to prove a property is not set by the overall design complexity. State of the art solvers are very good at cutting through a ton of logic to identify just the relevant parts. In solver terminology this is called an unsatisfiable core and on the hardware side this corresponds to a subcircuit that alone ensures that a property holds. That means you could change everything that is not part of this core circuit and the property would still hold. The complexity of this subcircuit is a much better indicator of the required solver effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are familiar with the cone of influence concept, where you find the relevant logic by following the circuit&amp;rsquo;s structure, this might sound familiar. An important difference is that solvers do not only consider the structure but also the behavior implemented by a circuit, which is more precise. Thus for the same property, an unsatisfiable core circuit can be much smaller than the cone of influence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For selecting between different projects within a single ASIC design, most of the projects&amp;rsquo; logic is not part of the unsatisfiable core. Only the logic responsible for selecting which tristate outputs are active together with the automatically added conflict checks needs to be considered. This is great because for medium to large projects with many source files, the solver can still provide an answer very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have experience with proving simple properties in large designs please let us know - we’re always interested in how people are using our tools.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;img src="http://blog.yosyshq.com/static-2022/YOS_horiz.png" alt="Featured image of post Tabby CAD Suite version 20220610 released!" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The June release of Tabby CAD Suite is now available for download.&lt;/p&gt;

    Yosys
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A big overhaul of memory inference in Yosys. The new pass &lt;code&gt;memory_libmap&lt;/code&gt; supports a wider variety of memory patterns, such as single-port memories or asymmetric memories. It will also strictly respect verilog semantics in cases of address collision, adding emulation circuitry to ensure the synthesized behavior matches simulation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To omit the emulation circuitry even in cases where it is required for correctness, you can add the &lt;code&gt;(* no_rw_check *)&lt;/code&gt; attribute to the array declaration of the memory. To disable collision handling globally, calling memory with the &lt;code&gt;-no-rw-check&lt;/code&gt; option is also possible (and the corresponding option has been added to all &lt;code&gt;synth&lt;/code&gt; passes using the new &lt;code&gt;memory_libmap&lt;/code&gt; pass).&lt;/p&gt;

    SBY
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;code&gt;tribuf&lt;/code&gt; pass now supports a &lt;code&gt;-formal&lt;/code&gt; option that converts inferred tri-state buffers within a module into equivalent non-tri-state logic for formal verification. It automatically adds assertions that detect multiple drivers driving the same net simultaneously. (When using tri-state I/O across modules, &lt;code&gt;tribuf -formal&lt;/code&gt; should be preceded by a &lt;code&gt;flatten&lt;/code&gt; pass).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Several changes in the handling of &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; values during formal verification.  In particular, when using the Verific frontend, during the initial time step, value change expressions (&lt;code&gt;$rose&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;$fell&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;$changed&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;$stable&lt;/code&gt;) are now always computed as if the argument changed from &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; to its initial value. This follows the SystemVerilog standard and ensures that any high (or low) signal starts at a step where &lt;code&gt;$rose&lt;/code&gt; (or &lt;code&gt;$fell&lt;/code&gt;) is true.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;code&gt;sim&lt;/code&gt; command now allows co-simulation with stimulus values from aiger and btor2 witness files as well as traces in VCD or FST format.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Co-simulation of designs with multiple clock domains was improved.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;--keep-going&lt;/code&gt; option was added to the smtbmc engine. With this option, the solver will continue to check the remaining properties even after an assertion fails. To use it, add the option between the engine and the solver in the &lt;code&gt;.sby&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  [engines]
  smtbmc --keep-going boolector
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JUnit report produced by sby will now list the status individually for each property when the engine supports it (currently only with smtbmc).&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;&#34; &gt;Yosys&lt;/a&gt; is probably best known for providing synthesis for FPGA targets, but it&amp;rsquo;s a very flexible tool capable of a lot more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;part-1-the-bad-news&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#part-1-the-bad-news&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    Part 1: The Bad News
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have recently added support for asynchronous load flip-flops to Yosys for a customer project. However, we consider this a problematic feature in a (System-)Verilog synthesis tool, and thus I’d like to take this opportunity to explain why one should avoid using asynchronous load flip-flops in new (System-)Verilog designs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-are-asynchronous-load-flip-flops&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-are-asynchronous-load-flip-flops&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    What are asynchronous load flip-flops
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;An asynchronous load flip-flop is a type of flip-flop with asynchronous reset for which the reset value is not a compile-time / synthesis-time constant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-SystemVerilog&#34; data-lang=&#34;SystemVerilog&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;reg&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;async_load_ff_q&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;wire&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;async_load_ff_reset_val&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;dynamic_expression&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;always_ff&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;@(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;posedge&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;clock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;posedge&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;load&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;load&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;async_load_ff_q&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;async_load_ff_reset_val&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;async_load_ff_q&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;...;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This distinguishes them from the more common asynchronous set (reset) flip-flops, for which the reset value is a compile-time (synthesis-time) constant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-SystemVerilog&#34; data-lang=&#34;SystemVerilog&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;reg&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;async_reset_ff_q&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;localparam&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;async_reset_ff_reset_val&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;constant_expression&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;always_ff&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;@(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;posedge&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;clock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;posedge&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;reset&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;reset&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;async_reset_ff_q&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;async_reset_ff_reset_val&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;       &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;async_reset_ff_q&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;...;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;IEEE Std 1364.1-2002, the IEEE Standard for Verilog Register Transfer Level Synthesis, does allow such asynchronous load flip-flops in synthesis, but states that the synthesis results will only match the behavior of the original Verilog code under certain conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-problem-with-verilog-and-asynchronous-load-flip-flops&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#the-problem-with-verilog-and-asynchronous-load-flip-flops&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    The problem with Verilog and asynchronous load flip-flops
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key insight is that the way an asynchronous reset is modelled using Verilog always blocks is not sensitive to the data signals providing the asynchronous load value. Thus, if the data signals are changing while the asynchronous reset is active, the new data is not loaded into the flip-flop when neither clock nor the asynchronous reset is toggling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Running it without and with &lt;code&gt;-DDOUBLE_ARST&lt;/code&gt; produces the following output:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ make run0

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the first case with a single pulse on arst, the second counter is reset to the non-zero value of the first counter from before the reset pulse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a real-world asynchronous load flip-flop would of course behave like a transparent latch while the reset pulse is high, propagating the new (zero) value of the first counter to the second counter register. But this only happens in simulation when we pulse the reset signal a second time.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can lead to non-trivial simulation-synthesis mismatches that are hard to debug, and may result in a chip that does not function as expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, asynchronous load flip-flops should be avoided in (System)Verilog designs, or at least it should be formally verified that the asynchronous load value of such a flip-flop can never change while the reset signal is active.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is in line with IEEE Std 1364.1-2002 requirements for sequential logic verification:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asynchronous data is assigned, the asynchronous data shall not change during the period in which the asynchronous control (the condition under which the data is assigned) is active.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;IEEE Std 1364.1-2002, Section 4.2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that a similar problem exists with flip-flops that have both asynchronous set and reset: If both are asserted and then one is released after the other, the one that’s released later should take precedence over the one that’s released earlier. However, since the always block is not triggered by the falling edge of the set or reset signal, releasing just one of the two will have no effect on the flip-flop output. IEEE Std 1364.1-2002 also acknowledges this issue:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem occurs when both reset and preset are asserted at the same time and reset is removed first. When reset is removed (posedge rst_n), the always block is not activated. This means that the output will continue to drive the reset output to ‘0’ until the next rising clock edge. A real flip-flop of this type would immediately drive the output to ‘1’ because the set_n signal is an asynchronous preset. This potentially could cause a mismatch between pre-synthesis and post-synthesis simulations using this model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;IEEE Std 1364.1-2002, Appendix B.6&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    Instantiate (Vendor) Primitives
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best and easiest way of dealing with this issue is to instantiate FF primitives directly. This can either be vendor cells, or a user-defined module for which we chose different implementations for simulation and synthesis, one with correct simulation behavior, and one that is synthesizable, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new DUT would look something like this (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/YosysHQ-Docs/Blog-Async-Load-FFs/blob/main/dut_myff.sv&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When instantiating a Vendor primitive one should always double-check that the vendor simulation library does model asynchronous loads correctly, for example using the techniques described in the next two sections.&lt;/p&gt;

    Simulation model using Verilog UDP
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Verilog UDP primitives can be used to correctly model the behavior of asynchronous load flip-flops. But UDPs are not synthesizable, so we need to also provide a synthesizable implementation of an asynchronous load flip-flop (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/YosysHQ-Docs/Blog-Async-Load-FFs/blob/main/myff_udp.sv&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, sprinkling procedural assign and deassign statements and ifndef-SYNTHESIS-blocks all over the design is much more error prone than implementing this work-around only once in a custom cell type that can then be instantiated wherever needed.&lt;/p&gt;

    The latch+flip-flop trick
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following technique is used on some FPGA architectures to emulate asynchronous-load flip-flops using latches and asynchronous-reset flip-flops only. It can be used to completely avoid asynchronous-load FFs while preserving the semantic of such elements (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/YosysHQ-Docs/Blog-Async-Load-FFs/blob/main/myff_hack.sv&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;// output either the latched reset value or clocked data value
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;assign&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;q&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;last_event_was_clock&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;q_without_reset&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;latched_rval&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Running our test-bench a last time gives the expected result for this solution as well:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;iverilog -g2012 -o sim5 -s tb tb.sv dut_myff.sv myff_hack.sv
./sim5
  0  0
 35  0
  0  0 &amp;lt;--
  0 55
  0  0
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a useful last resort solution for designs that absolutely require asynchronous-load flip-flop semantics, and where the risks associated with using different synthesis and simulation models for such a component are not acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>App Note 109</title>
        <link>http://blog.yosyshq.com/p/ap109/</link>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;This Application Note was written with the intention of showing a brief introduction to SVA, and is definitely not a substitute for extensive training. To learn more about formal verification and SVA, it is recommended to book the course given by the FPV specialists at YosysHQ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A brief history of SystemVerilog Assertions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SVA layers definition and examples&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assertion types, sequential property operators&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A short description of liveness and safety properties&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Practical examples using the sequence builder module written by our CTO Claire Xen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://yosyshq.readthedocs.io/projects/ap109&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;For a long time people have asked us for quality long form content that shows how to
get the best from our formal tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have started a series of app notes, with the first being about cover and witness for SVA properties. Otherwise known as &amp;lsquo;Am I testing what I think I&amp;rsquo;m testing&amp;rsquo;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What You will learn in this app note:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Default clocking and default disable declarations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sequences and cycle delays&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overlapping and non-overlapping implication syntax and semantic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weak precondition cover and witness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to apply that to a practical HDL code example&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
