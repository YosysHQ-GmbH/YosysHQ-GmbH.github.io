      <description>FazyRV Welcome to another community spotlight article where we shine a light on open source EDA-related projects. If you want to submit a project, please do so here.&#xA;FazyRV is a minimal-area RISC-V core that scales with your needs. It allows you to adapt the data path width to process smaller 1, 2, 4, or 8-bit chunks of the 32-bit operands each clock cycle. In addition, each data path width can be combined with FazyRV&amp;rsquo;s manifold variants to trade area with performance and find the best-fitting configuration for your system requirements and used technology.</description>

      <description>Surfer Welcome to another community spotlight article where we shine a light on open source EDA projects. If you want to submit a project, please do so here.&#xA;Surfer is a new waveform viewer with a focus on extensibility and a snappy (optionally keyboard driven) UI. It runs both natively and in web-assembly, so you can try it out right here in the browser at https://app.surfer-project.org. The project is written in rust and while it is still in its early stages, it is usable as a day-to-day wave viewer.</description>
