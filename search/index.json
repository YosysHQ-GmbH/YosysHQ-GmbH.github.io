[{"content":"This guest post is by Gabriel Gouvine.\nApplying logic locking to a TinyTapeout design with Moosic When creating a design, most of us are not in possession of the lithography and manufacturing tools necessary to actually create the chip: we send our design to a foundry and they make the chip for us.\nThis requires a great deal of trust in the toolchain and the foundry: a malicious actor could introduce backdoors, or just steal the design to reuse it themselves. For security-conscious designers, countermeasures are necessary.\nOne such countermeasure is logic locking: we are going to lock our design, so that it does not work without a secret key. We do it by adding or changing some gates in the design to use the key: if the key is incorrect, the design behaviour will be completely modified. This is going to make it harder to reuse the design without authorization (you have to find the key) or to introduce backdoors (you have to understand what it does).\nWe built a Yosys plugin to do just that. The plugin provides a logic_locking command that will mangle the design as much as it can.\nTo illustrate, let\u0026rsquo;s make a design on TinyTapeout, lock it and synthesize it all the way to silicon.\nWhat is logic locking The goal of logic locking is to make the design unusable without the right key. Usually, we apply it after synthesis, when the design is already mapped to logic gates. Logic locking adds new gates that will change the behaviour of the design unless the right key is provided. Our tool does it by adding Xor and Xnor gates, as shown below, but you can imagine a lot of ways to insert or replace gates. If a 0 is set for a Xor gate, or a 1 for a Xnor gate, the design works as before. It acts as a countermeasure rather than a cryptographic security. Much like software countermeasures it will not stop a determined attacker with unlimited resources, but it\u0026rsquo;s one more thing that an attacker will have to break.\nThe logic locking tool needs to decide where to insert the gates. Its goal is to disrupt the design as much as possible, and ideally make the key hard to guess by running and analyzing the design. The tool will analyze the impact of inserting a locking gate, and pick the places that maximize its estimated security, typically signals that have a large impact on the design\u0026rsquo;s behaviour. Ultimately, it\u0026rsquo;s a tradeoff between security and performance: for security, the more gates you insert the better, but this makes the circuit bigger and slower.\nJust a few percents of the gates locked is almost always enough to completely corrupt the design. We can explore the tradeoff with the plugin. For example, on this benchmark, locking just 13% of the signals breaks all outputs and all testcases:\nLocking a design We are going to make a toy design to experiment with logic locking. I wrote a counter, that is incremented at each clock cycle where do_incr is set:\nmodule counter ( input wire do_incr, output wire [7:0] data_out, input wire clk, input wire rst_n ); reg [7:0] counter; assign data_out = counter; always @(posedge clk) begin if (!rst_n) begin counter \u0026lt;= 0; end else if (do_incr) begin counter \u0026lt;= counter + 1; end end endmodule We run Yosys with the Moosic plugin. Since logic locking works on a netlist, we first synthesize our counter with the default library:\nread_verilog src/counter.v synth Now we apply locking and save our netlist. To fit in our 8-bit input port, I picked a small 6-bit key. With only 64 possible values, it is easy to brute-force, so make it a lot bigger if you use it in the wild! And don\u0026rsquo;t lose the key.\nlogic_locking -key-bits 6 -key 39 write_verilog src/locked_counter.v Looking at the file, our module is now a netlist with an additional port moosic_key. Following TinyTapeout\u0026rsquo;s philosophy, it all runs as a Github action.\nmodule counter(do_incr, data_out, clk, rst_n, moosic_key); input do_incr; output [7:0] data_out; input clk; input rst_n; input [5:0] moosic_key; TinyTapeout With TinyTapeout, we can synthesize this design to silicon. We will have to make a wrapper in order to load the key on our design\u0026hellip; and test that our design works as expected when the key is provided. The main project file will be responsible for loading the key. We are going to keep it simple and read the key directly from the primary inputs. On a production design, getting the key in would be part of the boot sequence.\nTo make sure it all works, we wrote a testbench that checks that our counter behaves as expected\u0026hellip; and is indeed broken with the wrong key.\nAnd finally we have the full masks for the design! The code for the TinyTapeout project is available here, and our locked counter will be on the TT06 chip when it tapes out. If you want to go further, have a look at the project page or our Free Silicon Conference presentation.\nFor power users, the plugin provides a lot of additional options to pick your security metrics, or to balance security and performance. Logic locking is an active area of research, and we are happy to provide an open-source tool to apply it to your designs.\n","date":"2024-01-30T12:00:00+02:00","image":"http://blog.yosyshq.com/static-2024/locking.png","permalink":"http://blog.yosyshq.com/p/logic-locking-with-moosic/","title":"Logic Locking with Moosic"},{"content":"We have recently started a Yosys User\u0026rsquo;s Group.

If you want to submit a project, please do so here.\nSurfer is a new waveform viewer with a focus on extensibility and a snappy (optionally keyboard driven) UI. It runs both natively and in web-assembly, so you can try it out right here in the browser at https://app.surfer-project.org. The project is written in rust and while it is still in its early stages, it is usable as a day-to-day wave viewer.\nFrans Skarman\u0026rsquo;s Bio I am a 5th year PhD student at the department of electrical engineering at Linköping university in Sweden. I\u0026rsquo;m originally a software person, who started off in game development and then descending lower and lower in the tech stack until I reached this wonderful world of hardware. The whole time, i\u0026rsquo;ve been most interested in writing tools; initially game engines instead of games, and now compilers instead of actual hardware design. My main project these days is https://spade-lang.org/ a hardware description language inspired by modern software languages.\nOutside of programming I enjoy some 3d printing, playing flight simulators, as well as sailing or skiing when the weather permits.\nI also need to give credit to Lucas who was featured in the last community spotlight, and my PhD advisor Oscar who have contributed a ton of features and fixes to the project.\nWhat motivated you to make Surfer? When building my HDL, Spade, I ran into a problem. With a powerful type system, the bit representation of a signal is often hard to understand, so you need a way to automatically translate the values back into their human-readable representation to effectively debug your designs. While gtkwave has support for custom translation via external programs, it turned out to be quite hard to get right and wasn\u0026rsquo;t as powerful as I wanted. For example, I found no way to translate a value into a list of expandable sub-fields to, for example, expand individual fields of a struct. I was also bothered by small things like how zooming and scrolling works in gtkwave.\nEventually, the question of \u0026ldquo;how hard can it be\u0026rdquo; made me start this project. Luckily, it turns out that with the right libraries, the answer to that question was that it is easier than I thought it would be.\nWhat makes you excited about Surfer? Overall, I\u0026rsquo;m very excited about having a mostly solid waveform viewer where I and others can try out new things, both in terms of translations and interface. I do have some favorite features I can touch more on though:\nWeb assembly Perhaps my favorite thing about Surfer right now is that it works almost flawlessly in web assembly. You can see a demo of that at https://app.surfer-project.org. If you have a VCD file to analyse, you can just append that to the URL along with some commands to run when the waveform is loaded, for example https://app.surfer-project.org/?load_url=https://app.surfer-project.org/picorv32.vcd\u0026startup_commands=module_add%20testbench;divider_add%20.;divider_add%20top;module_add%20testbench.top;show_quick_start.\nApart from being a cool tech demo, this also enables some cool workflow in CI/CD. For example, we can augment the tinytapeout test action to link to surfer with the resulting waveform. No longer will you have to re-run your tests locally, or manually download a VCD file to view it in a desktop viewer.\nI\u0026rsquo;m also very happy that going from idea to implementation of the web version took less than a day thanks to the rich rust ecosystem around web assembly.\nSignal translation As I mentioned earlier, a big motivator for building surfer was being able to get richer translation of Spade types. Even though I had a hacky system for doing that in gtkwave, the Surfer version where you can expand or collapse structs, view individual enum variants and translate sub-fields as you please is a game changer.\nBelow is an image and a quick demo video showing it off Another really cool translator is the RISC-V opcode translator shown below\nI have also done my best to build this translation system to be decoupled from Spade, meaning that anyone could add translation for their own HDLs constructs, or perhaps something completely different, like a translator that splits a stereo audio signal into left and right channels. All that is needed for that is to implement a few methods in a trait\nKeyboard and mouse gesture based UI As a vim user, I hate reaching for my mouse, so we\u0026rsquo;ve put quite a bit of effort into making surfer usable with just the keyboard. There are some keybindings for normal navigation of course, but most of the happens via a fuzzy matching based command palette, similar to ctrl-p in Visual Studio Code. For tasks where the mouse is more appropriate, like navigating the waveform there is also a mouse gesture based UI. You can see both in action in the video below.\nWhy do you make open source tools? Every time I have to use non-open source software I get frustrated, sometimes because dealing with licenses but often just because the software is missing features or customization options that I want, or because features I rely on get removed in a new version. These frustrations happen less with open source software in my experience. Since I probably wouldn\u0026rsquo;t use a closed source tool myself, I\u0026rsquo;m certainly not going to build one.\nFor surfer in particular, one of the big advantages of open source is that everyone can add their favorite features, whether it is a translator for a new signal format, a new way to render waves or some new way to interact with the program, things that a closed source developer might not have the interest nor resources to implement. After a while, this makes an open source tool feel very complete, because all the small features and fixes have been added.\nWhat are some challenges? The biggest challenge in my mind is in UI design. I\u0026rsquo;m not a UI designer, I only took a single course on it during my bachelor, so most of the time I\u0026rsquo;m just winging it. For features I use myself, I at least have some idea of what I want, for feature requests by others I might even have that.\nThere have also been some technical hurdles, primarily because we offload the parsing of wave files to external libraries. For now we only support VCD, but we are working on both decoupling surfer from the VCD library, as well as adding support for other formats, in particular FST.\nWhat could the community do to support you? First, give surfer a try. Let us know what you find nice and what could use improvements. Especially as a non-UX person it is invaluable to get feedback from users!\nIf you want to do more, consider contributing the features you think are missing. In particular, small features like a translator for a new bit format, a fix for a small bug you find or perhaps some additional way to zoom or navigate the waveforms. As I said earlier, people contributing these small things are what gives open source software that warm feeling that someone has thought of your particular use case.\nOf course, we\u0026rsquo;re also very happy to accept bigger contributions, like support for loading files from other wave formats or big translators for translating to the native format from some alt-HDL like Amaranth, Chisel or Clash.\nWhat is the best link to give for the project?

You can check out my first attempt on my blog learn-fpga-easily. Formal Verification helps ensure that certain properties of your design always remain true, such as:\nBus arbitration: \u0026ldquo;Only one master can receive the bus grant at any given time.\u0026rdquo; Overflow and Underflow: \u0026ldquo;The FIFO buffer will never overflow or underflow.\u0026rdquo; State Machine Reachability: \u0026ldquo;The state machine can never transition from state_1 to state_3.\u0026rdquo; These kinds of properties would normally require an extensive functional testbench for coverage. However, with formal verification and SBY, they can be easily addressed with just a few assertions and assumptions.\nGiven my newfound knowledge, it seemed completely natural that after embarrassingly failing to solve a Sudoku puzzle with my grandfather – a hit to my pride – I decided to repurpose the use of SBY just to figure out a Sudoku solution.\nToday, I am excited to share with you my overkill attempt to solve a simple Sudoku puzzle with SBY and Formal Verification.\nModeling the Sudoku In Verilog, we can represent a Sudoku grid straightforwardly: a two-dimensional register encompassing 9 rows and 9 columns, where each cell occupies 4 bits:\nmodule sudoku ( input clk, ); // Internal 9x9 grid to make operations more intuitive (* keep *) reg [3:0] sudoku_grid[8:0][8:0]; `ifdef FORMAL // see next section `endif endmodule Using the (* keep *) attribute ensures our register won\u0026rsquo;t be discarded during synthesis, even if it isn\u0026rsquo;t used anywhere.\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s it! Now, let\u0026rsquo;s dive into the interesting part: Formal Verification.\nHow to solve a sudoku with Formal Verification ? Formal verification involves setting specific properties that your design must always satisfy. The formal solver then evaluates a vast array of mathematically choosen scenarios. If a property doesn\u0026rsquo;t always hold true, the solver will tell you: \u0026ldquo;Nope, your property does not hold true in this counter-example.\u0026rdquo;\nBut here\u0026rsquo;s the catch: If we lay down just one property, the solver might churn out a completely irrelevant solution. Take Sudoku: Every row in a correctly solved grid has every digits from 1 to 9. One obvious property is the sum of digits in a row totaling 45 (because 1+2+3+\u0026hellip;+9=45). Yet, with just this, the solver might suggest a row like: 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,45. Clearly flawed, given illegal numbers and the repetition.\nWe must assume additional properties to narrow down the solution space and obtain relevant counterproofs:\nIn digital design, we assume valid input behavior, focusing assertions on internal and output signals. For this Sudoku escapade, where we\u0026rsquo;re playfully repurposing the tool, assumptions will lean on the sudoku_grid register (typically a target for assertions). So, what assumptions should we make for Sudoku? The basic rules.\nAssuming the Basic Rules All digits should be between 1 and 9. Which translates to: `ifdef FORMAL // variables declaration for all forloops genvar box_row, box_col, i, j, k, m, n; // assume all the digits are between 1 and 9 generate for(i = 0; i \u0026lt; 9; i = i + 1) begin : digit_assumption_i for(j = 0; j \u0026lt; 9; j = j + 1) begin: digit_assumption_j always @(posedge clk) begin assume(sudoku_grid[i][j] \u0026lt;= 4\u0026#39;d9); assume(sudoku_grid[i][j] \u0026gt;= 4\u0026#39;d1); end end end endgenerate With these assumptions, the solver won\u0026rsquo;t try any numbers that are outside of this range.\nAll digits in a row are all different generate for(i = 0; i \u0026lt; 9; i = i + 1) begin: row_check for(j = 0; j \u0026lt; 9; j = j + 1) begin: column_j for(k = j + 1; k \u0026lt; 9; k = k + 1) begin: column_k always @(posedge clk) begin assume(sudoku_grid[i][j] !== sudoku_grid[i][k]); end end end end endgenerate All digits in a column are all different generate for(i = 0; i \u0026lt; 9; i = i + 1) begin: column_check for(j = 0; j \u0026lt; 9; j = j + 1) begin: row_j for(k = j + 1; k \u0026lt; 9; k = k + 1) begin: row_k always @(posedge clk) begin assume(sudoku_grid[j][i] !== sudoku_grid[k][i]); end end end end endgenerate All digits in a box are all different generate for(box_row = 0; box_row \u0026lt; 3; box_row = box_row + 1) begin: box_row_check for(box_col = 0; box_col \u0026lt; 3; box_col = box_col + 1) begin: box_col_check for(i = 0; i \u0026lt; 3; i = i + 1) begin: row_i_check for(j = 0; j \u0026lt; 3; j = j + 1) begin: col_j_check for(m = 0; m \u0026lt; 3; m = m + 1) begin: row_m_check for(n = 0; n \u0026lt; 3; n = n + 1) begin: col_n_check // Make sure we\u0026#39;re not comparing the same cell to itself if(i !== m || j !== n) begin always @(posedge clk) begin assume(sudoku_grid[(3*box_row)+i][(3*box_col)+j] !== sudoku_grid[(3*box_row)+m][(3*box_col)+n]); end end end end end end end end endgenerate The initial grid cannot be changed. // assume the intial grid always @(posedge clk) begin : initialization //line 1 assume(sudoku_grid[0][0]==5); assume(sudoku_grid[0][2]==7); assume(sudoku_grid[0][3]==2); assume(sudoku_grid[0][7]==9); //line 2 assume(sudoku_grid[1][2]==6); assume(sudoku_grid[1][5]==3); assume(sudoku_grid[1][6]==7); assume(sudoku_grid[1][8]==1); //line 3 assume(sudoku_grid[2][0]==4); assume(sudoku_grid[2][7]==6); //line 4 assume(sudoku_grid[3][0]==1); assume(sudoku_grid[3][3]==4); assume(sudoku_grid[3][4]==9); assume(sudoku_grid[3][8]==7); //line 5 assume(sudoku_grid[4][3]==5); assume(sudoku_grid[4][5]==8); //line 6 assume(sudoku_grid[5][0]==8); assume(sudoku_grid[5][4]==2); assume(sudoku_grid[5][5]==7); assume(sudoku_grid[5][8]==5); //line 7 assume(sudoku_grid[6][1]==7); assume(sudoku_grid[6][8]==9); //line 8 assume(sudoku_grid[7][0]==2); assume(sudoku_grid[7][2]==9); assume(sudoku_grid[7][4]==8); assume(sudoku_grid[7][6]==6); //line 9 assume(sudoku_grid[8][1]==4); assume(sudoku_grid[8][5]==9); assume(sudoku_grid[8][6]==3); assume(sudoku_grid[8][8]==8); end Using SBY to solve the Grid With the game rules handed over to our solver, we want it to return the solution now.\nAs highlighted before, in a correctly solved Sudoku, every row, column, or box\u0026rsquo;s digit sum is 45. We simply need to request an example where this property holds true. And since there\u0026rsquo;s only one such example, it elegantly unfolds as our desired Sudoku solution.\n// Ask SBY to explicitly cover the (only) case where sum=45s wire [5:0] sum; assign sum = sudoku_grid[0][0] + sudoku_grid[0][1] + sudoku_grid[0][2] + sudoku_grid[0][3] + sudoku_grid[0][4] + sudoku_grid[0][5] + sudoku_grid[0][6] + sudoku_grid[0][7] + sudoku_grid[0][8]; always @(*) begin cover(sum==6\u0026#39;d45); end `endif FORMAL endmodule Let\u0026rsquo;s run the verification To install SBY and all the required formal solvers, I recommend following the straightforward installation process provided by oss-cad-suite.\nTo execute the verification, we\u0026rsquo;ll need our sudoku.v file and a SBY configuration file named sudoku.sby with the content below:\n[options] mode cover [engines] smtbmc [script] read -formal sudoku.v prep -top sudoku [files] sudoku.v All we have to do is run the following command :\nsby -f sudoku.sby And as you can see\u0026hellip; it fails\u0026hellip; WAIT!

I\u0026rsquo;ve employed the pyDigitalWaveTools Python library to convert my VCD file into JSON format and have requested ChatGPT to create a script that reads the JSON and displays the solution in my terminal. All the sources can be accessed my github page.\nNow, the moment we\u0026rsquo;ve all been waiting for - the solution:\n5 1 7 | 2 6 4 | 8 9 3 9 2 6 | 8 3 5 | 7 4 1 4 8 3 | 9 7 1 | 5 6 2 --------------------- 1 3 5 | 4 9 6 | 2 8 7 7 9 2 | 5 1 8 | 4 3 6 8 6 4 | 3 2 7 | 9 1 5 --------------------- 3 7 8 | 6 4 2 | 1 5 9 2 5 9 | 1 8 3 | 6 7 4 6 4 1 | 7 5 9 | 3 2 8 Conclusion Let\u0026rsquo;s wrap this up. First off, if you\u0026rsquo;re ever stuck on that pesky Sudoku during a lazy Sunday afternoon, you now know there’s a\u0026hellip; let\u0026rsquo;s call it an “alternative” way to crack it. And check it is actually feasible.\nNow, on the real note: diving into techy stuff using simple problems we already know? It\u0026rsquo;s golden! It’s like trying to learn a new dance step with a song you already love. You get the hang of it faster and, more importantly, it\u0026rsquo;s fun. Playing around with SBY in this wild way just shows how cool and flexible these tools can be.\nBig Thanks to YosysHQ for letting me write on their blog.

If you want to submit a project, please do so here.\nWaveform Analysis Language (WAL) is a programming language for complex waveform analysis and EDA tool development.\nLucas Klemmer\u0026rsquo;s Bio I\u0026rsquo;m a PhD student at the Institute for Complex Systems at the Johannes Kepler University in Linz, Austria. I received my Master’s degree in computer science from the University of Bremen in Germany. My interests include RISC-V, HW verification and analysis, kayaking, and learning (natural) languages.\nWhat motivated you to make WAL? Waveforms contain so much interesting information; however, this information is “buried” in enormous amounts of data. Using general purpose languages can quickly become challenging to analyze waveforms because these languages have no concepts of time, design structure, and other things we in hardware care about. With WAL, we want to make it easy to analyze waveforms by integrating those concepts into the language to make it “hardware aware”. Simply speaking, a WAL program runs on your waveform, and you can use the waveform signals just like you use variables.\nWhy do you make open source tools? As a computer scientist coming to the hardware world, it was quite a culture shock when I had to use closed-source toolchains. However, in the last few years, this feeling changed from being shocked to being amazed by all the open-source hardware and EDA projects that emerged. With WAL, I hope that I can add my small contribution to this change!\nWhat are some challenges? Handling very large waveforms with WAL is possible, but more work on performance and optimizations is required. Moreover, the hardware domain requires a bit more work to win people for new ideas than in the software world.\nWhat could the community do to support you?

Where does one even begin? Also, if you\u0026rsquo;ve ever wondered how a CPU works and how you can build your own, keep reading!\nTL;DR: Getting into FPGA programming nowadays isn\u0026rsquo;t hard anymore. Get a cheap board with at least one LED that is supported by an open toolchain, search for a tutorial, and get that LED blinking!\nIntroduction As an experimental physicist, I have been working with FPGAs for many years. These versatile devices enable creating customized electronics for all kinds of applications. FPGAs typically contain thousands of mostly simple logic units that can be connected in sophisticated ways using a hardware description language (HDL). I have experience writing efficient software for low-latency embedded processors and have so far only made small adjustments to existing VHDL or Verilog projects. However, only recently have I had the opportunity to take a deeper dive into writing new logic designs from scratch.\nIt does not feel that long ago that FPGA boards were prohibitively expensive devices, and the tools and IP cores were not accessible to everyone. Starting development for FPGAs used to be a costly investment and close to impossible to do on a small budget. Luckily, this situation has changed. Small FPGA chips now sell for as low as $10, and a lot of development is done on free and open-source toolchains. As it turns out, with enough ambition and a bit of courage, one can achieve reasonable results in FPGA-land today without breaking the bank!\nFirst, find a project For me, it all started with a new project that involved creating a device capable of measuring arrival time and length of logic signals with sub-nanosecond precision. The idea was to create a low-cost spectrometer for measuring high-intensity gamma radiation and replacing the commonly used ADC (analog-to-digital converter) circuit with a TDC (time-to-digital converter) implemented in an FPGA. So, instead of measuring the amplitude of the signal, only the time the signal spends above a certain threshold (time-over-threshold) is measured. This design reduces the system complexity but requires custom logic.\nChoose your tools I have seen many projects written in VHDL and Verilog, but for this one, I wanted to try one of the new HDL alternatives. My language of choice happened to be the Python-based Amaranth HDL (formerly known as nMigen), primarily because I had in mind to write the accompanying firmware for the device in MicroPython. I was also intrigued by Clash and SpinalHDL, but Amaranth seemed to have an easier learning curve. So, with the clear goal of creating a working TDC, I jumped headfirst into writing Amaranth code. Over the course of the next year (where I spent most of the time on system design and writing software), I became more familiar with the language and successfully finished the project on time for our customer.\nSet priorities While I was working on the project, I encountered many excellent resources and introductory courses for FPGA programming and logic design, and I read various code examples in different HDLs. I also questioned whether Amaranth was the right choice or if I should have chosen a more conventional language. One tutorial that particularly captured my attention was Bruno Levy\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Blinker to RISC-V\u0026rdquo;. The concept intrigued me; one starts with an innocent and all-too-familiar \u0026lsquo;blinky\u0026rsquo; example but ends up with a fully functional RISC-V CPU that can run code written by someone else. Following the tutorial for just 24 steps (the CPU executes the first code after step 7), I was curious to try it out immediately. However, I set it aside during the TDC project and only returned to it afterward.\nDefine your goals At that point, I had enough experience with Amaranth to tackle the tutorial as a practice exercise. Instead of using verilog, I followed Bruno\u0026rsquo;s tutorial in Amaranth HDL, using the open-source F4PGA (formerly Symbiflow) toolchain and an FPGA board that was not supported in the tutorial (Digilent CMOD A7 with Xilinx Artix 7). I wanted to see how far I could go and was unaware of the obstacles that lay ahead.\nDigilent CMOD A7 FPGA board with Xilinx Artix7. USB-UART dongle in the back.\nAnd get going! I started the course in December 2022 and published the first version, including step 18 (mandelbrot generator), by the end of February 2023. Here are some of the things I learned during these three months: even though I had used Amaranth HDL before, I needed to learn a few more tricks to translate the tutorial code. I learned how valuable instant feedback through test benches and simulations can be. Most of the time, if the simulated logic was working correctly, the hardware implementation was doing the right thing. I had long wondered what makes a CPU a CPU: what are the essential parts, and how do they all work together to execute a set of instructions and manipulate memory and/or pixels on the screen?\nThis is the question that the tutorial answered in great detail in the first 18 steps and unraveling the mystic black box that a CPU usually is, contributed to at least half the joy I experienced while putting together my own CPU. Bruno explains the RISC-V ISA and ABI, and together we build a more and more capable version of the processor step-by-step. At the same time, I learned the corresponding assembly language for RISC-V, which is essential for testing and programming the CPU at every step. The later steps focus on compiling third-party code with GCC and how to configure the linker so that code is executed from the correct piece of memory in the FPGA. I also learned a lot about compiled objects and ELF formats, which one usually doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to worry about when compiling for Linux-based systems.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s more to it! In addition to the obvious takeaways, there were also several unexpected events that occurred along the way. One significant obstacle was that Bruno\u0026rsquo;s tutorial came with a custom RISC-V assembler, written in Verilog, which assembled the instructions while compiling or simulating the logic. This meant that I had to figure out how to seamlessly integrate it with Amaranth. Moreover, I had to fill in jump offsets manually, which is not very convenient. To streamline the process, I went on a longer tangent to implement the assembler in Python. It was a challenging task, but I succeeded in achieving seamless integration with Amaranth, without the need for manual jump offsets. At a later step, Bruno incorporates the tiny UART sender by Olof Kindgren, I successfully ported it to Amaranth as well, which was a pleasant surprise since it almost worked on the first try.\nHowever, when I attempted to compile for the FPGA boards I had on hand, I realized that they were not supported by the amaranth-boards repository. Fortunately, I was able to modify a similar board description with the help of the reference manual for my hardware (and even get the code merged in time for this post). Meanwhile, I also discovered and fixed a bug in Amaranth itself, as well as some typos in Bruno\u0026rsquo;s tutorial. On more than one occasion I found out that I can effectively discover my own bugs by actually executing code on the CPU. I also learned how to use many great tools, such as Yosys, openFPGAloader, GTKWave, Verilator, and Edalize.\nI\u0026rsquo;m currently working through the last parts of Bruno\u0026rsquo;s tutorial, and while I still have a few steps to go, I\u0026rsquo;ve already learned a lot. Converting the examples to Amaranth HDL has been challenging, but not impossible. Personally, I enjoy working with Amaranth because its semantics are clear and it offers the full power of Python when needed. While some things are more verbose in Amaranth (such as Mux() and Repl()) than their Verilog counterparts, others can be written more concisely.\nI could not have done it alone During the process, I\u0026rsquo;ve had many questions about Amaranth, the build system, the toolchain, and the hardware. Luckily, the helpful community on IRC (#amaranth-lang on libera.chat) and GitHub has always been quick to respond. Additionally, documentation for open toolchains and developing with these tools has greatly improved in the past year.\nStill, some endurance is needed to pull through, when things don\u0026rsquo;t work as expected. For example, my board and one of my chips were not supported by Amaranth, and I encountered issues compiling on an older laptop with an unsupported 32-bit host architecture. I also found myself in python package hell on more than one occasion. And as they say, the devil is in the details, since some seemingly small steps have taken considerably more time than anticipated (\u0026ldquo;proceed after you have a working RISC-V assembler\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;we\u0026rsquo;ll use this existing UART module\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;now just convert the ELF to HEX format\u0026rdquo;).\nFinal thoughts Despite these challenges, my plan is to continue with the tutorial and get the SPI interface working. In the meantime, I\u0026rsquo;m also working on getting support for the free Gowin toolchain (project apicula) into Amaranth\u0026rsquo;s build system. Looking ahead, I\u0026rsquo;m excited to apply the things I\u0026rsquo;ve learned from (not strictly) following Bruno\u0026rsquo;s tutorial to other projects. I\u0026rsquo;d also encourage anyone interested in these concepts to take their favorite HDL and port the tutorial. For me, this has been a great experience, and I\u0026rsquo;m certain that with a growing user base, FPGA design will become even more accessible than it is today!\nAbout the author Dr. Bastian Löher (Twitter: @y__, Mastodon: @bl0x@mastodon.social) ported Bruno Levy\u0026rsquo;s FPGA tutorial to Amaranth HDL.

If you want to submit a project, please do so here.\nAutoSVA makes Formal Property Verification (FPV) more accesible for hardware designers.\nMarcelo Vera\u0026rsquo;s Bio Marcelo is a PhD candidate in the Department of Computer Science at Princeton University advised by Margaret Martonosi and David Wentzlaff. He received his BSE from University of Murcia. Marcelo is interested in hardware innovations that are modular, to make SoC integration practical. His research focuses on Computer Architecture, from hardware RTL design and verification to software programming models of novel architectures. He has previously worked in the hardware industry at Arm, contributing to the design and verification of three GPU projects, and at Cerebras Systems, creating High-Performance Computing kernels. At Princeton, he has contributed in two academic chip tapeouts that aims to improve the performance, power and programmability of several emerging workflows in the broad areas of Machine Learning and Graph Analytics.\nWhat was your motivation in making AutoSVA? AutoSVA was build with the goal of making Formal Property Verification (FPV) more accesible for hardware designers. AutoSVA brings a simple language to make annotations in the signal declaration section of a module interface. This enables us to generate FPV testbenches that check that transactions between hardware RTL modules follow their interface specifications. It does not check full correctness of the design but it automatically generate liveness properties (prevent duplicated responses, prevent requests being dropped) and some safety-relate properties of transactions, like data integrity, transaction invariants, uniqueness, stability\u0026hellip;\nWhy do you develop open source tools? As the title of our paper suggests \u0026ldquo;Democratizing Formal Verification of RTL Module Interactions” the motivation on making the tool was to make FPV more accesible for hardware designers without much prior knowledge in formal methods. Thus, open-sourcing makes the most sense when the goal is to get people to use your tool.\nWhat are some of the challenges you face? Hardware RTL projects can be very heterogeneous, I made the language and tool pretty flexible to take any Verilog or SystemVerilog, but I wouldn’t be surprise it the tool complained about some syntax or some include files. The tool also has a way to set inlcude paths on the tool command line, but you never know!\nWhat could the community do to support you? I would be happy if the community would keep using it, find limitations, and extend the tool. There are plenty of opportunities to add functionality. I’m working myself on an extension to automatically find timing channels via hardware state left unflushed between context switches.

You can find the first part here.\nIn this blogpost I will show you how to set up, synthesize and program your first Verilog program on the ECP5 FPGA using the Yosys suite.\nThe FPGA toolchain The FPGA workflow consists of a few more steps compared to the usual software toolchain workflow.\nThe Verilog source, which is a description of the logic that makes up the FPGA design, first needs to be synthesized. The synthesis process scans through all the source files and libraries to find out the hierarchy of the modules, starting with the specified top module. The result of this process is a low level logical representation of all the abstract components that will make up the final design. In the FPGA flow, this step is done by the yosys program, and results in a JSON file.\nThe next step in the toolchain is place-and-route. This is where the process becomes specific to the target FPGA family, because it takes the abstract components and maps it to physical parts that make up the FPGA. The logical design is translated into configuration data for all the switches, lookup tables and registers in the FPGA\u0026rsquo;s macroblocks. Yosys suite includes the Nextpnr tool which does this step. For our board, which runs on the Lattice ECP5 fpga, we will have to use the nextpnr-ecp5 program. This will give us a .config file which represents the configuration of the fpga.\nThe last step is to upload the configuration data to the target FPGA. This step can have many forms, but in Yosys it has two parts: packing and uploading. First, the configuration data needs to be packed into a format that is recognized by the FPGA controller. This is done with the ecppack executable. We will use ecppack to create an SVF (Serial Vector Format). The SVF is a pretty ingenious hack - the file contains plain JTAG commands that need to be sent to the target, which makes it independent from the JTAG adapter. Using SVF, in principle, you can program any JTAG device with any JTAG adapter. The second part is the actual upload of the SVF to the device. We will use openocd to communicate with our JTAG adapter and upload the SVF file with configuration data to it. After the upload is complete, the FPGA will start running.\nHello, blink! For our journey into getting the board to blink, we will use the following Verilog. It\u0026rsquo;s a simple clock divisor module whose output is connected to an IO pin on the FPGA that is connected to the onboard LED.\nmodule top(input clk_i, output led_o); reg led_reg; wire baseclk; clkdiv #(.DIV(2000000)) slowclk (clk_i, baseclk); always @(posedge baseclk) begin; led_reg \u0026lt;= !led_reg; end assign led_o = led_reg; endmodule module clkdiv #(parameter DIV = 24'd5000)( input wire clk_i, output wire clk_o ); reg [24:0] count = 25'b0; reg clk_o_internal = 1; //on this board we have a 25MHz clock always @(posedge clk_i) begin count \u0026lt;= count + 25'b1; if(count == DIV) begin count \u0026lt;= 25'b0; clk_o_internal \u0026lt;= ~clk_o_internal; end end assign clk_o = clk_o_internal; endmodule This piece of Verilog will take the clock input from the onboard oscillator, divide it by 500 thousand and output the divided clock to output led_o.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve called the file blink.v. Now we need to synthesize it using yosys:\nyosys -p \u0026quot;synth_ecp5 -top top -json blink.json\u0026quot; blink.v It is important to specify the top module by name using the -top \u0026lt;name\u0026gt; option. Otherwise yosys may pick the wrong module as the top and later cause an error due to unconstrained IOs.\nThe next step is to assign the logic IOs from the verilog modules to physical pins on the FPGA. This is necesary for the Place and Route step and is done by a constraints file. Looking up q3k\u0026rsquo;s repository on the 5A-75B board we can find out that the clock is connected to FPGA pin P6, and the onboard led is connected to T6. Here is how the LPF file looks like. I saved it as blink.lpf:\nLOCATE COMP \u0026quot;clk_i\u0026quot; SITE \u0026quot;P6\u0026quot;; IOBUF PORT \u0026quot;clk_i\u0026quot; IO_TYPE=LVCMOS33; LOCATE COMP \u0026quot;led_o\u0026quot; SITE \u0026quot;T6\u0026quot;; IOBUF PORT \u0026quot;led_o\u0026quot; IO_TYPE=LVCMOS25; Now we can run the Place and Route program, nextpnr-ecp5:\nnextpnr-ecp5 --json blink.json --textcfg blink_out.config --25k --package CABGA256 --lpf blink.lpf We specify the parameters of the ECP5 FPGA: device type LFE5U-25F (--25k) and the package type.\nWith the output config file all we need to do is to pack the bitstream into an SVF file:\necppack --svf blink.svf blink_out.config blink.bit With the SVF file it\u0026rsquo;s time to program the bitstream into the FPGA. Connect it to your JTAG adapter and power.\nopenocd -f colorlight_5a75b.cfg -c \u0026quot;svf -quiet -progress blink.svf; exit\u0026quot; The file colorlight_5a75b.cfg contains my openocd configuration:\nsource [find interface/jlink.cfg] adapter_khz 500 transport select jtag jtag newtap ecp5 tap -irlen 8 -expected-id 0x41111043 init scan_chain targets svf -tap ecp5.tap -quiet -progress blink.svf exit the jtag newtap ... line defines a new Test Access Port that corresponds to the FPGA\u0026rsquo;s TAP.

Although I have gained experience since starting the project, I still depend on insight and advice from those who actually work on hardware and synthesis flows.\nSystemVerilog is also a difficult language to work with due to its complexities and ambiguities. Even commercial toolchains vary in terms of feature support, strictness, and behavior. This can make it challenging to decide what language features to implement and how to translate them correctly.\nWhat could the community do to support you? I am always eager to receive more feedback. It is difficult to gauge interest in features or discover issues without users sharing their thoughts. The feedback I’ve received to date has been essential in making sv2v what it is today.\nFor those with experience with functional programming or compilers and an interest in SystemVerilog, there are a number of features and improvements that may be suitable for an outside collaborator.

This is all made possible by combining the OSS CAD Suite with CFlexHDL and PipelineC.\nSummary In this article we present a tool flow that takes C++ code describing a raytraced game, and produces digital logic that can be implemented in off-the-shelf FPGAs (with no hard or soft CPU used). We aim for these tools to achieve a software friendly C-to-FPGA flow, making the development + simulation process exceptionally fast and easy, while providing high performance and low power hardware results.\nThanks to project Trellis, Yosys and nextpnr can complete an open source synthesis and place and route flow for ECP5 FPGAs. This was the final piece needed to complete our C-\u0026gt;Bitstream workflow based on fully open source tools.\nDemo video and full sources: https://github.com/JulianKemmerer/PipelineC-Graphics\nFPGA as a raytracer Interactive ray tracing hardware is novel in FPGA and our work serves as a perfect example that such complex data processing circuits can be developed, tested, and implemented in hardware all from a C language based flow that greatly eases the design process over traditional hardware description languages.\nUltra-fast compiled C based emulation and C++ based tools like Verilator allow for fast simulation with realtime debug. This quick workflow is essential, being able to compile-as-C and see the results of code changes executed in realtime is a requirement for developing an interactive game, something not possible with standard FPGA simulators.\nThe project generates each video pixel in hard-realtime “chasing the beam”, without a frame buffer and with zero jitter. Medium size Xilinx Artix 7 FPGAs have reached up to 1080p 60FPS (148.5MHz pixel clock). This article describes using an Lattice ECP5 FPGA to reach 480p 60FPS (25MHz pixel clock). Pipelining the entire ray tracer produces a position-to-color latency of a few microseconds at most. 1080p requires about ~400 pipeline stages, 480p requires ~70 stages - in both cases this pipelining is done automatically as part of the tool flow.\nThe Xilinx Artix 7 FPGA achieves about 70 GFLOP/s using less than 1 watt, thanks to the pipeline with dozens of hardware resources working in parallel. Using that 28nm Xilinx 7 series FPGA, power reduction was calculated to be about 50X less compared with a modern 7nm CPU running heavily vector optimized instructions.\nWorkflow The workflow allows writing algorithms involving complex types like structures, floating point types and operations on vectors of those, all keeping a clean and familiar syntax.\nThe source code is first converted by the CflexHDL tool from C++ to C. Then this subset of C can be converted to VHDL by PipelineC . GHDL and Yosys are used to convert the output VHDL into netlists that nextpnr can use.\nIn addition to simple conversion to VHDL, PipelineC is primarily the mechanism for producing pipelined digital logic from the pure combinatorial logic derived from C code. PipelineC is aware of the FPGA timing characteristics of the specific device (by iterating with nextpnr) and adds pipelining as needed to meet timing. This avoids the tedious and error-prone task of manual pipelining that digital designers are familiar with. The flow reports a preliminary estimate of resources prior to synthesis and the amount of pipeline stages required to implement the user’s functionality.\nTo produce a final bitstream GHDL+Yosys are used to generate a flattened single Verilog file version of the design that can easily be incorporated into existing build flows for board specific bitstream support, ex. Litex Orange Crab.\nAlternatively, the sources can be compiled and run “as C”, as a kind of ultra-fast emulation/simulation (the game can be played in FullHD at 60FPS during debug on PC), or the Verilog sources can be processed by Verilator and graphically simulated by another tool we provided.\nFrom inside the PipelineC-Graphics repository there is one command to go from C file to the final bitstream generation and load your FPGA board: make load. See additional instructions on github.\nHardware architecture The project uses a fully open source board based on a Lattice ECP5 FPGA with 85K LUTs (the OrangeCrab board) plus a PMOD-compatible digital video connector for direct connection to a monitor by adapting 3.3V signals to the required CML levels (Machdyne DDMI), they publish schematics as well. For simplicity, only the positive polarity and ground were connected: it works since the differential levels are met, at least on our test setup. The integrated button on the FPGA board is used to play the game.\nThis setup allowed 640x480 resolution (25MHz clock) instead of 1920x1080 (148.5MHz clock) as achieved with the original setup using a Xilinx 7 series FPGA device.\nThe FPGA design consists of two main blocks: a state machine computing frame-by-frame animation and a long pixel rendering pipeline.\nTo meet 25MHz timing on the Lattice ECP5 FPGA the PipelineC tool created a pixel rendering pipeline of approximately ~70 stages. Below is a visual breakdown of how many stages each major function takes and roughly where/when in the pipeline it occurs:\nThe above pipeline uses operations on custom floating and fixed point types.\nOperation Stages Fixed Compare 1 stage Fixed Addition/Subtraction 2 stages Fixed Multiplication 2 stages Float Compare 2 stages Float Multiplication 2 stages Float Addition/Subtraction 3 stages Float Fast Reciprocal 3 stages Float Fast Reciprocal Square Root 3 stages Float Fast Square Root 3 stages Float Fast Division 4 stages Float 3D Vector Dot Product 5 stages Float 3D Vector Normalize 7 stages Ray Plane Intersection 10 stages Ray Sphere Intersection 22 stages Float types use a 14 bit mantissa instead of the typical 23 bits, and fixed point values are represented with a total of 22 bits: 12 for integer portion, 10 for the fractional bits. Those types are provided by CflexHDL types and the effects of reduced precision can be readily appreciated with the provided graphical simulation tool, so the optimal size is easy to determine by performing the fast simulations.\nFull precision vs. reduced precision in simulator window\nTypical times for development/test cycles are as follows:\nBuild command Build time Speed @1080p Fast CPU simulation make sim 1s 60-86 FPS Precise CPU simulation make gen 5s 40FPS Logic simulation make verilator 1min 50s 50s per frame Software architecture and components All software and tools used in this project are Open Source. We integrated the following components:\nPipelineC for C to VHDL, autopipelining (uses pycparser) CflexHDL for C++ parsing, fixed point types and arbitrary width floating point types, and vector of these using operator overloading Clang’s cindex to help in parsing C++ Verilator for logic level simulation Custom simulator based on the SDL libraries (used when compiling the raytracer, or after Verilator C++ generation) YosysHQ\u0026rsquo;s Yosys for Verilog parsing and synthesis NextPNR for place and route (project Trellis) GHDL from a Yosys plugin for VHDL to Verilog conversion (used by Verilator and for synthesis) LiteX for Orange Crab SoC design, and its video core with serialized digital outputs (DVI) About OSS CAD Suite Integration The first version of the project used a commercial FPGA board and closed-source synthesis tools. After Project Trellis reverse-engineered the ECP5 device there were only a few minor workarounds that were needed to complete the chain of “everything open source” with Yosys and nextpnr.\nPart of PipelineC’s autopipelining iterations involve synthesizing the design purely as combinatorial logic (pre-pipelining). The share pass that Yosys uses by default for synth_ecp5 does not handle the massive combinatorial network that defines the ray tracer design very well. RAM usage (typically ~8GB max) quickly jumps past the 16GB we had on our workstations. Disabling the share pass required editing the Yosys source code to remove the specific ECP5 run step.\nThe second issue we ran into was that in early versions of ECP5 place and route support, nextpnr was not able to pack LUTs+FFs into the shared primitive block as effectively as today. As such, early attempts failed to place and route the design while still having relatively plenty of resources remaining. But after the packing support improved, nextpnr began to produce fully placed and routed designs that could be further iterated on for pipelining. Related: often the nextpnr tool would end up in an infinite loop trying to fix a few remaining overused/unrouted wires - but recent changes seem to have reduced that issue as well.\nSince the PipelineC tool generates VHDL, we needed to convert the final generated sources to a single Verilog file (to be used in Verilator simulation and to generate the bitstream). This is done using the GHDL plugin for Yosys and the Yosys write_verilog command. Occasionally Yosys passes like opt and flatten were needed during the import process in order to avoid spikes in RAM usage.\nNone of these issues were blockers for long. We credit success to the fantastic open source community that provided lots of help in forums and discussions.\nConclusions We showed a ready-to-use toolchain for hardware design that greatly accelerates development time by using fast simulators at different stages, based on a known programming language syntax. The code can be translated to a logic circuit or run on a off-the-shelf CPU. A example application requiring complex processing was demonstrated by writing a game that implements the usual math operations for raytracing applications, with a clean syntax for math and all the algorithms. Since we apply an automatically calculated -and possibly long- pipeline, the system is capable of performing very well even compared to powerful modern CPUs, but using smaller and embeddable chips, at low power.\nAbout the authors This work is a result of the tight interactions between Julian Kemmerer (@pipelinec_hdl; fosstodon.org/@pipelinec) and Victor Suarez Rovere (Twitter: @suarezvictor) during almost a year.\nVictor Suarez Rovere is the author of CflexHDL tool used in this project (parser/generator and math types library) and of the Sphery vs. Shapes game.

If you want to submit a project, please do so here.\nTbengy by Prasad Pandit is a Python Tool for SV/UVM Testbench Generation and RTL Synthesis. The tool uses newly available capability of the Vivado tool by Xilinx to compile and run SV/UVM Testbench and syntheize RTL for Digilent FPGA Boards.\nThe project is hosted on Github under an MIT License:\nhttps://github.com/prasadp4009/tbengy\nPrasad Pandit\u0026rsquo;s Bio I am a Hardware Engineer by profession which is my hobby as well. I enjoy tinkering with FPGAs, Arduinos and building IoT devices to make my life more easy. My interest revolves around making chips and building things with 3D printers.\nMotivation to make tbengy: I have been developing and using small python scripts for personal use. During the pandemic, as we all know many people lost their jobs including engineers from the Semiconductor Industry. In the same time period, I got a chance to tinker with my FPGAs and was working on developing a tool that can help me create a project skeleton as well as scripts to test my design and verify them. When it comes to design compilation, whether it\u0026rsquo;s VHDL, Verilog or Systemverilog we have a lot of open-source as well as commercial tools, problem comes when we want to compile UVM for verification. There isn\u0026rsquo;t much scope for people other than using EDAPlayground or use Commercial tools which are not easily available. Also maintaining projects on EDAPlayground in a structured way is not supported.\nWhile updating my Vivado, I read the release notes and found that the Webpack version (free version) now supports complete UVM 1.2 compilation and simulations. This gave me the idea to build a python tool \u0026ldquo;tbengy\u0026rdquo;, which can run on any OS (Windows or Linux) and generates an easily editable and compilable UVM testbench in a structured manner and scripts which will help engineers interested in UVM verification to hone their skills on their machine. I also added support for a Blinky project which generates design, DV and synthesis scripts for all Digilent boards.\nWhy open source? I believe in open collaboration. Linux is the best example of what open source can bring to this world and that inspired me to be a part of this community. The Open source tools like MAGIC and OpenROAD which today makes it possible for anyone to design ASICs right from their own machine, this is another motivation for me to give more to this community.\nWhat are the challenges? Being a hardware engineer, software is not my expertise. This became more evident to me when I created string templates in python where after some research I figured there are template libraries like Jinja2, which if used will help a lot in bringing the knowledge of hardware with use of more structured and efficient software in making better tools.\nWhat could the community do to support you? I found out that it\u0026rsquo;s difficult to get your work reviewed in open source and tapping the right audience. I will be glad if experienced users both from hardware and software domain can review the tool and provide better direction as well as requirements will help in taking the tool to the next level.\nConnect with Prasad Pandit LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/panditprasad/ YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@PrasadPandit Twitter: https://twitter.com/@tonystark_hdl ","date":"2022-12-14T10:23:57+01:00","image":"http://blog.yosyshq.com/static-2022/spotlight/spotlight.png","permalink":"http://blog.yosyshq.com/p/community-spotlight-tbengy/","title":"Community Spotlight - Tbengy"},{"content":"The December release of Tabby CAD Suite is now available for download.

You may also know that it\u0026rsquo;s much more than that: in my earlier blog post about CXXRTL I call it the swiss army knife of digital logic manipulation.\nIn most cases, using Yosys means running pre-made scripts that contain Yosys commands: when I\u0026rsquo;m synthesizing RTL for an FPGA of the Lattice iCE40 family, the synth_ice40 command is usually sufficient to convert my RTL into a netlist that can be sent straight to nextpnr for place, route, and bitstream creation.\nMy current version of Yosys has 232 commands, and many of these commands have an impressive list of additional options, but sometimes you want to perform very particular logic operations that don\u0026rsquo;t come standard with the tool.\nIn this blog post, I\u0026rsquo;ll talk about the techmap command, a particularly powerful command that allows one to make custom logic transformations by replacing a logic cell instance of a given type to one or more different ones.\nMapping a multiplication to an FPGA DSP Cell There is a companion yosys_techmap_blog project on GitHub that contains the Verilog source files and the scripts to generate the graphics and Yosys results of this blog post.\nA good example of a techmap operation is one where a generic multipication is converted into a DSP block of an FPGA. For those who are unfamiliar with the technology, FPGAs usually have only a few core logic primitives: lookup-table cells (LUTs) are used to construct any kind of random logic circuit, RAM cells are, well, RAMs, and DSPs are larger cells that contain one or more hardware multipliers, often in combination with an accumulator.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s look at this Verilog module, mul.v, that multiplies two 10-bit values into a 20-bit result:\nmodule top(input [9:0] op0, input [9:0] op1, output [19:0] result); assign result = op0 * op1; endmodule When reading in the Verilog file, Yosys translates it into RTLIL (RTL Internal Language), the internal representation of the design. The multiplication operation becomes a $mul primitive, and the whole design looks like this:\nmodule \\top wire width 10 input 1 \\op0 wire width 10 input 2 \\op1 wire width 20 output 3 \\result cell $mul $mul$mul.v:3$1 parameter \\A_SIGNED 0 parameter \\A_WIDTH 10 parameter \\B_SIGNED 0 parameter \\B_WIDTH 10 parameter \\Y_WIDTH 20 connect \\A \\op0 connect \\B \\op1 connect \\Y \\result end Yosys has the super useful show command that renders an RTLIL representation as a graph. I usually add the -width -signed options to annotate signals with their size and to show which cell ports are signed:\nThis primitive must be converted into cells of the target technology. Most FPGAs from the iCE40 family have a handful of DSPs. When you synthesize this module to the iCE40 technology with synth_ice40 -dsp, the $mul primitive gets converted to an SB_MAC16 cell which is the DSP primitive of the iCE40 family.\nThe SB_MAC16 DSP has a ton of data path and configuration signals, and the multiplier inputs and output can be up to 16 and 32-bits wide respectively. It\u0026rsquo;s up to a techmap step to assign all the right values to the configuration signals, and to correctly tie down unused input data bits or ignore excess output bits so that the DSP performs the desired 10-bit x 10-bit multiplication.\nAfter cleaning up some irrelevant cruft, the post-synthesis RTLIL looks like this:\nmodule \\top wire width 10 input 1 \\op0 wire width 10 input 2 \\op1 wire width 20 output 3 \\result wire \\result_SB_MAC16_O_ACCUMCO wire \\result_SB_MAC16_O_CO wire width 12 \\result_SB_MAC16_O_O wire \\result_SB_MAC16_O_SIGNEXTOUT cell \\SB_MAC16 \\result_SB_MAC16_O parameter \\A_REG 1\u0026#39;0 parameter \\A_SIGNED 0 parameter \\BOTADDSUB_CARRYSELECT 2\u0026#39;00 parameter \\BOTADDSUB_LOWERINPUT 2\u0026#39;10 parameter \\BOTADDSUB_UPPERINPUT 1\u0026#39;1 parameter \\BOTOUTPUT_SELECT 2\u0026#39;11 parameter \\BOT_8x8_MULT_REG 1\u0026#39;0 parameter \\B_REG 1\u0026#39;0 parameter \\B_SIGNED 0 parameter \\C_REG 1\u0026#39;0 parameter \\D_REG 1\u0026#39;0 parameter \\MODE_8x8 1\u0026#39;0 parameter \\NEG_TRIGGER 1\u0026#39;0 parameter \\PIPELINE_16x16_MULT_REG1 1\u0026#39;0 parameter \\PIPELINE_16x16_MULT_REG2 1\u0026#39;0 parameter \\TOPADDSUB_CARRYSELECT 2\u0026#39;11 parameter \\TOPADDSUB_LOWERINPUT 2\u0026#39;10 parameter \\TOPADDSUB_UPPERINPUT 1\u0026#39;1 parameter \\TOPOUTPUT_SELECT 2\u0026#39;11 parameter \\TOP_8x8_MULT_REG 1\u0026#39;0 connect \\A { 6\u0026#39;000000 \\op0 } connect \\ACCUMCI 1\u0026#39;x connect \\ACCUMCO \\result_SB_MAC16_O_ACCUMCO connect \\ADDSUBBOT 1\u0026#39;0 connect \\ADDSUBTOP 1\u0026#39;0 connect \\AHOLD 1\u0026#39;0 connect \\B { 6\u0026#39;000000 \\op1 } connect \\BHOLD 1\u0026#39;0 connect \\C 16\u0026#39;0000000000000000 connect \\CE 1\u0026#39;0 connect \\CHOLD 1\u0026#39;0 connect \\CI 1\u0026#39;x connect \\CLK 1\u0026#39;0 connect \\CO \\result_SB_MAC16_O_CO connect \\D 16\u0026#39;0000000000000000 connect \\DHOLD 1\u0026#39;0 connect \\IRSTBOT 1\u0026#39;0 connect \\IRSTTOP 1\u0026#39;0 connect \\O { \\result_SB_MAC16_O_O \\result } connect \\OHOLDBOT 1\u0026#39;0 connect \\OHOLDTOP 1\u0026#39;0 connect \\OLOADBOT 1\u0026#39;0 connect \\OLOADTOP 1\u0026#39;0 connect \\ORSTBOT 1\u0026#39;0 connect \\ORSTTOP 1\u0026#39;0 connect \\SIGNEXTIN 1\u0026#39;x connect \\SIGNEXTOUT \\result_SB_MAC16_O_SIGNEXTOUT end end And here\u0026rsquo;s the equivalent graphical representation. (Click to enlarge)\nAll Yosys commands are written in C++, but in the case of techmap the specific mapping operations are described in\u0026hellip; Verilog! It\u0026rsquo;s a very neat system that makes it possible for anyone to create their own custom mapping operations without the need to touch a line of C++.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s see exactly how that works for our example, and look at the source code of the synth_ice40 command.\nYosys places all the technology-specific operations under the techlibs directory. The code for synth_ice40 can be found in techlibs/ice40/synth_ice40.cc. synth_ice40 doesn\u0026rsquo;t really have any smarts by itself: it\u0026rsquo;s a macro command, a series of lower level Yosys commands strung together into a recipe.\nWhen you run help synth_ice40 in Yosys, you\u0026rsquo;ll see the following command line option:\n-dsp use iCE40 UltraPlus DSP cells for large arithmetic It\u0026rsquo;s easy to see which steps are activated in the source code when DSP mapping is enabled:\nrun(\u0026#34;memory_dff\u0026#34; + no_rw_check_opt); // ice40_dsp will merge registers, reserve memory port registers first run(\u0026#34;wreduce t:$mul\u0026#34;); run(\u0026#34;techmap -map +/mul2dsp.v -map +/ice40/dsp_map.v -D DSP_A_MAXWIDTH=16 -D DSP_B_MAXWIDTH=16 \u0026#34; \u0026#34;-D DSP_A_MINWIDTH=2 -D DSP_B_MINWIDTH=2 -D DSP_Y_MINWIDTH=11 \u0026#34; \u0026#34;-D DSP_NAME=$__MUL16X16\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;(if -dsp)\u0026#34;); run(\u0026#34;select a:mul2dsp\u0026#34;, \u0026#34; (if -dsp)\u0026#34;); run(\u0026#34;setattr -unset mul2dsp\u0026#34;, \u0026#34; (if -dsp)\u0026#34;); run(\u0026#34;opt_expr -fine\u0026#34;, \u0026#34; (if -dsp)\u0026#34;); run(\u0026#34;wreduce\u0026#34;, \u0026#34; (if -dsp)\u0026#34;); run(\u0026#34;select -clear\u0026#34;, \u0026#34; (if -dsp)\u0026#34;); run(\u0026#34;ice40_dsp\u0026#34;, \u0026#34; (if -dsp)\u0026#34;); run(\u0026#34;chtype -set $mul t:$__soft_mul\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;(if -dsp)\u0026#34;); There\u0026rsquo;s quite a bit going on here, but the most interesting command is this one:\ntechmap -map +/mul2dsp.v -map +/ice40/dsp_map.v -D DSP_A_MAXWIDTH=16 -D DSP_B_MAXWIDTH=16 -D DSP_A_MINWIDTH=2 -D DSP_B_MINWIDTH=2 -D DSP_Y_MINWIDTH=11 -D DSP_NAME=$__MUL16X16 What we see here is that techmap is performing the $mul to SB_MAC16 conversion in two steps:\nconvert $mul to a generic, technology independent DSP multiplier cell. convert the generic multiplier DSP cell to an iCE40 DSP cell. Step 1: mul2dsp.v\nStep 1 is done by mul2dsp.v. The code is a bit convoluted, but it has the answer as to why there\u0026rsquo;s this intermediate step:\nit deals with cases where a single $mul operation requires more than one DSP.\nFor example, a 32-bit x 32-bit to 64-bit multiplication is split into 4 16x16=32 multiplications and some additions.\nit doesn\u0026rsquo;t do the conversion when the inputs of the multiplication are too small\nThis avoids wasting precious DSP resources on something that can be implemented with core logic.\nThe -D ... arguments of the techmap command specify Verilog defines that are passed to the techmap file. It\u0026rsquo;s used to parameterize the conversion process:\n-D DSP_A_MAXWIDTH=16 -D DSP_B_MAXWIDTH=16 informs mul2dsp that the maximum input size of the DSP is 16 bits. -D DSP_A_MINWIDTH=2 -D DSP_B_MINWIDTH=2 -D DSP_Y_MINWIDTH=11 provides the minimum requirements that must be satisfied to do the conversion. -D DSP_NAME=$__MUL16X16 provides the name of the generic multiplier cells that should be created. We can run that first step by ourselves and check the result:\nread_verilog mul.v clean -purge techmap -map +/mul2dsp.v -D DSP_A_MAXWIDTH=16 -D DSP_B_MAXWIDTH=16 -D DSP_A_MINWIDTH=2 -D DSP_B_MINWIDTH=2 -D DSP_Y_MINWIDTH=11 -D DSP_NAME=$__MUL16X16 clean -purge show -width -signed -format png -prefix mul_mul2dsp In case you were wondering, here\u0026rsquo;s what this first step looks like for a 20-bit x 20-bit to 40-bit multiplier:\n(Click to enlarge)\nYosys can often create very long internal labels that stretch the graphical representation, so I zoomed the image to the part that counts. The 3 red rectangles are the $__MUL16X16 cells that will be converted to iCE40 DSPs. The blue rectangle is a $__soft_mul cell that will be converted into random logic at a large stage, and the 3 green rectangles are $add cells to bring the results of the different multipliers together.\nStep 2: ice40/dsp_map.v\nStep 2 of the techmap process, ice40/dsp_map.v is trivial: it converts the generic $__MUL16X16 multiplier cell into an SB_MAC16 cell, wires up the data path inputs and output, and straps all the other configuration inputs so that the cell is configured as a straight multiplier.\nmodule \\$__MUL16X16 (input [15:0] A, input [15:0] B, output [31:0] Y); parameter A_SIGNED = 0; parameter B_SIGNED = 0; parameter A_WIDTH = 0; parameter B_WIDTH = 0; parameter Y_WIDTH = 0; SB_MAC16 #( .NEG_TRIGGER(1\u0026#39;b0), .C_REG(1\u0026#39;b0), .A_REG(1\u0026#39;b0), .B_REG(1\u0026#39;b0), .D_REG(1\u0026#39;b0), .TOP_8x8_MULT_REG(1\u0026#39;b0), .BOT_8x8_MULT_REG(1\u0026#39;b0), .PIPELINE_16x16_MULT_REG1(1\u0026#39;b0), .PIPELINE_16x16_MULT_REG2(1\u0026#39;b0), .TOPOUTPUT_SELECT(2\u0026#39;b11), .TOPADDSUB_LOWERINPUT(2\u0026#39;b0), .TOPADDSUB_UPPERINPUT(1\u0026#39;b0), .TOPADDSUB_CARRYSELECT(2\u0026#39;b0), .BOTOUTPUT_SELECT(2\u0026#39;b11), .BOTADDSUB_LOWERINPUT(2\u0026#39;b0), .BOTADDSUB_UPPERINPUT(1\u0026#39;b0), .BOTADDSUB_CARRYSELECT(2\u0026#39;b0), .MODE_8x8(1\u0026#39;b0), .A_SIGNED(A_SIGNED), .B_SIGNED(B_SIGNED) ) _TECHMAP_REPLACE_ ( .A(A), .B(B), .O(Y), ); endmodule A Horribly Contrived Example Problem Have a look at the following Verilog example code:\nmodule top_unsigned(input [5:0] op0, input [6:0] op1, output [63:0] sum); assign sum = op0 + op1; endmodule The graphical representation is as expected:\nI sometimes use CXXRTL to simulate my designs. When I run write_cxxrtl, the generated file contains the following:\nbool p_top__unsigned::eval() { bool converged = true; p_sum0 = add_uu\u0026lt;64\u0026gt;(p_op0, p_op1); return converged; } This is exactly as expected, and there\u0026rsquo;s nothing wrong with it. But one thing that bothers me is that CXXRTL uses 32-bit integer values (\u0026ldquo;chunks\u0026rdquo;) for all its operations. In the code above, there\u0026rsquo;s a 64-bit addition, and CXXRTL implements those by splitting things up into multiple 32-bit additions:\ntemplate\u0026lt;bool Invert, bool CarryIn\u0026gt; std::pair\u0026lt;value\u0026lt;Bits\u0026gt;, bool /*CarryOut*/\u0026gt; alu(const value\u0026lt;Bits\u0026gt; \u0026amp;other) const { value\u0026lt;Bits\u0026gt; result; bool carry = CarryIn; for (size_t n = 0; n \u0026lt; result.chunks; n++) { result.data[n] = data[n] + (Invert ? ~other.data[n] : other.data[n]) + carry; if (result.chunks - 1 == n) result.data[result.chunks - 1] \u0026amp;= result.msb_mask; carry = (result.data[n] \u0026lt; data[n]) || (result.data[n] == data[n] \u0026amp;\u0026amp; carry); } return {result, carry}; } It\u0026rsquo;s a hand-crafted carry-ripple adder. Now, don\u0026rsquo;t worry, things are really not as bad as it seems, because all the variables that are used for the if conditionals and the for loop are constants. Any good C++ compiler will optimize the addition above into only a few assembler instructions.\nIf you know your binary adder basics, you see that the addition of a 7-bit and a 6 bit operand will result at most in an 8-bit result. All higher bits will always be 0. It\u0026rsquo;s overkill to have a 64-bit adder.\nYosys already has the wreduce command that reduces logic operations to just the number of bits that are really needed.\nWe can see this when we run the following commands:\nread_verilog add.v hierarchy -top top_unsigned wreduce clean -purge And here\u0026rsquo;s the relevant CXXRTL generated code:\nbool p_top__unsigned::eval() { bool converged = true; p_sum0.slice\u0026lt;7,0\u0026gt;() = add_uu\u0026lt;8\u0026gt;(p_op0, p_op1); p_sum0.slice\u0026lt;63,8\u0026gt;() = value\u0026lt;56\u0026gt;{0u,0u}; return converged; } That looks better, but is that really true? The addition returns an 8-bit value, but since the smallest chunk is 32-bits, the slice\u0026lt;7,0\u0026gt; command now requires a read-modify-write operation.\nWhat I really want is this:\nbool p_top__unsigned::eval() { bool converged = true; p_sum0.slice\u0026lt;31,0\u0026gt;() = add_uu\u0026lt;32\u0026gt;(p_op0, p_op1); \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; 32 bits p_sum0.slice\u0026lt;63,32\u0026gt;() = value\u0026lt;32\u0026gt;{0u,0u};\t\u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; 32 bits return converged; } Unfortunately, Yosys doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a command that does this for me, and I really don\u0026rsquo;t want to modify the C++ code of the wreduce command to make it so.\nA Custom Techmap Transformation to the Rescue! If you start Yosys, running help techmap will give you an exhaustive list of all the features that you might ever need. But instead of repeating everything in there, let\u0026rsquo;s create an add_reduce techmap transformation to solve the problem of the previous section.\nHere are some of the basics of a techmap transformation Verilog module:\na techmap transformation only operates on a single design cell.\nYou can not use techmap to perform multi-cell optimizations such mapping a $mul followed by an $add onto an FPGA DSP has multiply-accumulator support.\na design cell that is transformed by a techmap is selected by a string that contains a list of cell types that are specified with the (* techmap_celltype \u0026quot;...\u0026quot;) attribute. If the techmap module doesn\u0026rsquo;t have such an attribute, then it\u0026rsquo;s determined by the name of the Verilog module.\nby default, a techmap operation will iterate on itself until there\u0026rsquo;s nothing left that matches.\nIf a techmap operation replaces an $add primitive by a new $add primitive, techmap will run again on the second one. Without some kind of abort mechanism, this will result in an endless loop!\nThere are multiple ways to avoid such an endless loop though. I\u0026rsquo;ll get to that later.\nit\u0026rsquo;s always a good idea to normalize the configuration on which you want to do the main transformation.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a good example of what I mean by that: we want to reduce the size of an adder based on the size of its inputs. But an adder has 2 inputs, and if these inputs have a different size, then the transformation will have a different code path depending on which input is largest.\nHowever, an addition is commutative: the order of the inputs doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s easier first do a normalization where the A input is guaranteed to be larger or equal than the B input by swapping the inputs, so that actual reduction transformation only has to deal with one case.\nThe earlier discussed mul2dsp techmap module does the same thing.\nThe add_reduce techmap module declaration\nIn this example, I want a transformation that only works on an $add instance, so I could create a techmap Verilog module like this:\nmodule \\$add(A, B, Y); ... But I prefer to use a descriptive name for the module and use the (* techmap_celltype ...) option to select the cell types on which the module operates:\n(* techmap_celltype \u0026#34;$add\u0026#34; *) module add_reduce(A, B, Y); ... The add_reduce techmap module interface\nThe techmap module interface should be the same as the cell on which it operates. Both the input/output signals and the parameters must be the same. Yosys has a Verilog file called simlib.v that contains the reference simulation modules of all its internal primitives. You can use this to check out the interface details of particular primitive.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the one for the $add primitive\nmodule \\$add (A, B, Y); parameter A_SIGNED = 0; parameter B_SIGNED = 0; parameter A_WIDTH = 0; parameter B_WIDTH = 0; parameter Y_WIDTH = 0; input [A_WIDTH-1:0] A; input [B_WIDTH-1:0] B; output [Y_WIDTH-1:0] Y; The add_reduce techmap module has the same interface:\n(* techmap_celltype = \u0026#34;$add\u0026#34; *) module add_reduce (A, B, Y); parameter A_SIGNED = 0; parameter B_SIGNED = 0; parameter A_WIDTH = 1; parameter B_WIDTH = 1; parameter Y_WIDTH = 1; (* force_downto *) input [A_WIDTH-1:0] A; (* force_downto *) input [B_WIDTH-1:0] B; (* force_downto *) output [Y_WIDTH-1:0] Y; The force_downto attribute ensures that the highest numbered bit of each signal is the MSB. When this attribute is present, Yosys will automatically swap around the bits of connected wires so that you don\u0026rsquo;t need to worry about wackos who use bit 0 as MSB.\nadd_reduce stop conditions\nSince we\u0026rsquo;re replacing an $add primitive with another $add primitive, we need to make sure that there are special conditions to prevent the techmap operation to run forever.\nWe can tell the techmap command to stop transforming the current cell instance by assigning a non-zero value to the _TECHMAP_FAIL_ wire:\nwire _TECHMAP_FAIL_ = 1; For this operation, we want stop transforming an $add primitive for a number of conditions:\nwhen the size of the adder is already equal or smaller than the minimal desired adder.\nWe can set the minimum size with the `Y_MIN_WIDTH define.\nWhen the size of the adder can\u0026rsquo;t be reduced because it would change the result of the calculation.\nWhen it\u0026rsquo;s a signed addition and we only want to transform unsigned additions.\nThe `REDUCE_SIGNED define must be set to allow signed adder transformation.\nThis translates into the following code:\nlocalparam SIGNED_ADDER = (A_SIGNED == 1 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; B_SIGNED == 1); generate if (Y_WIDTH \u0026lt;= `Y_MIN_WIDTH) begin wire _TECHMAP_FAIL_ = 1; end else if (Y_WIDTH \u0026lt;= A_WIDTH+1) begin wire _TECHMAP_FAIL_ = 1; end else if (SIGNED_ADDER \u0026amp;\u0026amp; !`REDUCE_SIGNED) begin wire _TECHMAP_FAIL_ = 1; end ... There are other ways to prevent techmap to run forever. For example, in the mul2dsp.v code, a $__soft_mul cell used instead of a $mul primitive. Yosys has no such primitive, but in a later step, after techmap has been completed, this $__soft_mul cell is converted back to a $mul$ cell:\nchtype -set $mul t:$__soft_mul add_reduce normalization\nThe normalization code of add_reduce is pretty much a straight copy of the one from mul2dsp:\ngenerate ... else if (B_WIDTH \u0026gt; A_WIDTH) begin \\$add #( .A_SIGNED(B_SIGNED), \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; A and B are swapped .B_SIGNED(A_SIGNED), \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; .A_WIDTH(B_WIDTH), \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; .B_WIDTH(A_WIDTH), \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; .Y_WIDTH(Y_WIDTH) ) _TECHMAP_REPLACE_ ( .A(B), \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; .B(A), \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; .Y(Y) ); end else if ... When using _TECHMAP_REPLACE_ as instance name of the swapped $add primitive, it will inherit the instance name of the original instance. This is one of the many predefined variables that are explained by running help techmap in Yosys.\nSince we replace $add with $add, running techmap will result in the $add cell being transformed twice times if B is larger than A: the first time to swap the inputs, and the second time for the actual reduction.\nIf techmap needs to transform the same cell multiple times, it can be hard to debug. You can use the -max_iter \u0026lt;number\u0026gt; option to limit the number of transformations.\nFor example, here\u0026rsquo;s what the design originally looked like:\nAnd here\u0026rsquo;s how things look when stopping the add_reduce operation after the first iteration:\ntechmap -map add_reduce.v -max_iter 1 clean -purge op1 with the largest input size of 7 is now connected to A!\nThe actual add_reduce transformation\nNow that all preliminary formalities are behind use, the actual reduction code is pretty straightfoward:\nelse begin localparam ADDER_WIDTH = `MAX(`Y_MIN_WIDTH, A_WIDTH+1); \\$add #( .A_SIGNED(A_SIGNED), .B_SIGNED(B_SIGNED), .A_WIDTH(A_WIDTH), .B_WIDTH(B_WIDTH), .Y_WIDTH(ADDER_WIDTH) ) _TECHMAP_REPLACE_ ( .A(A), .B(B), .Y(Y[ADDER_WIDTH-1:0]) // Reduced output size ); // Higher bits are 0 or sign extension assign Y[Y_WIDTH-1:ADDER_WIDTH] = { (Y_WIDTH-ADDER_WIDTH){SIGNED_ADDER ? Y[ADDER_WIDTH-1] : 1\u0026#39;b0} }; end The final add_reduce.v code can be found here. We can run the whole thing with:\ntechmap -map add_reduce.v -D Y_MIN_WIDTH=32 clean -purge The result is exactly what we wanted, as shown in the graphical diagram\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;and in the CXXRTL-generated code:\nbool p_top__unsigned::eval() { bool converged = true; p_sum0.slice\u0026lt;31,0\u0026gt;() = add_uu\u0026lt;32\u0026gt;(p_op1, p_op0); p_sum0.slice\u0026lt;63,32\u0026gt;() = value\u0026lt;32\u0026gt;{0u}; return converged; } Formal Equivalence Check Whenever you do logic transformations, it\u0026rsquo;s not a bad idea to check that the pre- and post-transformation logic behaves exactly the same. Yosys has a basic built-in equivalence checker. It\u0026rsquo;s not a performance monster, but it\u0026rsquo;s good enough for this kind of use case.\nIn the example below, I\u0026rsquo;m verifying the add_reduce techmap on a design with an adder that has an output that\u0026rsquo;s 10 instead of 64 bits, and the minimum size is set to 8. This makes the size of the graphs more managable.\n# Load the original design read_verilog add.v hierarchy -top top_unsigned10 rename top_unsigned10 top_unsigned # Make a golden reference copy of the unmodified design copy top_unsigned top_unsigned_gold # Select the original version to do the techmap select top_unsigned # Do the techmap on top_unsigned techmap -map add_reduce.v -D Y_MIN_WIDTH=8 clean -purge So far, so good: Yosys now has 2 designs. top_unsigned_gold is the original one:\nAnd top_unsigned has been transformed with the techmap:\nLet\u0026rsquo;s compare them:\nequiv_make top_unsigned_gold top_unsigned top_equiv select top_equiv The equiv_make has the golden and the transformed design as input and creates a new design with $equiv primitive cells inserted at the output of both designs. These cells will tell the equivalence checker which nets to check for formal equivalence. The new design top_equiv looks like this:\n(Click to enlarge)\nAs you can see, the new design has both the golden and the transformed logic on the left, driven by the same inputs. For there are 10 $equiv cells, one for each bit of the output.\nWe can now run the equivalence check:\nequiv_simple You\u0026rsquo;ll see something like this:\n8. Executing EQUIV_SIMPLE pass. Found 10 unproven $equiv cells (1 groups) in top_equiv: Grouping SAT models for \\sum0: Trying to prove $equiv for \\sum0 [0]: success! Trying to prove $equiv for \\sum0 [1]: success! Trying to prove $equiv for \\sum0 [2]: success! Trying to prove $equiv for \\sum0 [3]: success! Trying to prove $equiv for \\sum0 [4]: success! Trying to prove $equiv for \\sum0 [5]: success! Trying to prove $equiv for \\sum0 [6]: success! Trying to prove $equiv for \\sum0 [7]: success! Trying to prove $equiv for \\sum0 [8]: success! Trying to prove $equiv for \\sum0 [9]: success! Proved 10 previously unproven $equiv cells. Each individual bit has been proven to be correct.\nWe can make Yosys fail if there were any unproven $equiv cells, like this:\nequiv_status -assert However, in our case, all is well:\n9. Executing EQUIV_STATUS pass. Found 10 $equiv cells in top_equiv: Of those cells 10 are proven and 0 are unproven. Equivalence successfully proven! We\u0026rsquo;ve now proven that our add_reduce techmap is correct, but that doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean it\u0026rsquo;s guaranteed bug free: we\u0026rsquo;ve only tested one combination of input and output signal sizes. To be absolutely sure, you\u0026rsquo;d need more variety of test cases.\nThis is only a quick example of what Yosys can do, there\u0026rsquo;s a variety of additional equivalence and logic proof features, most of which I don\u0026rsquo;t know much about! You could start by checking out the help information for the equiv_*, miter, and sat commands to learn more.\nCleaning Up When Yosys creates new cells and reconnects wires, it won\u0026rsquo;t immediately delete older cells and wires that aren\u0026rsquo;t used anymore. You need to expliclity tell Yosys to do so with the clean -purge command that you can see in some of the command sequences above.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s what the reduced adder looks like without first running a clean:\nThat\u0026rsquo;s why you see a clean -purge statement all over the place in the script generates all the pretty pictures of this blog post.\nConclusion Techmap is a very nice tool to have to transform single cells into something that better maps to your chosen target. The example that I\u0026rsquo;ve given here is a bit dumb (I\u0026rsquo;m not even sure if it would actually result in better compiled CXXRTL code!), but it shows some of the potential of what can be achieved.\nI have only scratched the surface of what can be done with it: there are ways to make a techmap module behave differently based on whether or not certain input bits are constant, you can instruct Yosys to run another Yosys command after performing a techmap iteration, and so forth.\nIf you want to go deeper, you should definitely start by checking out the help instructions, not only of techmap command, but also some of the other ones.\nReferences Main Yosys repo on GitHub\nyosys_techmap_blog repo on GitHub\nContains the Verilog code and the Yosys scripts to generate all the graphs of this blog post.\n","date":"2022-11-24T09:38:52+02:00","image":"http://blog.yosyshq.com/static-2022/yosys_techmap/SB_MAC16_block_diagram.png","permalink":"http://blog.yosyshq.com/p/logic-primitive-transformations-with-yosys-techmap/","title":"Logic Primitive Transformations with Yosys Techmap"},{"content":"The November release of Tabby CAD Suite is now available for download.

Part 2 is now available here.\nIt seems that it was an accident - a generic part of a LED display has become a low cost FPGA development board. The board in question is the Colorlight 5A-75B, which is a so-called receiver card. Featuring a Lattice ECP5 FPGA, supported by Yosys, it allows you to leverage a fully open-source FPGA development toolchain. Priced on average at 20-25 USD, it is a very accessible board.\nThe Colorlight 5A-75B was originally a part of a modular LED display standard. It\u0026rsquo;s a receiver card, which means that it sits between the computer controlling the show, and the LED panels themselves. It fulfills a basic but crucial task of receiving the video signal and driving the RGB panels accordingly. This takes a lot of bandwidth, so it is equipped with a moderately fast ECP5 LFE5U25-F FPGA and two Gigabit Ethernet interfaces. There is also a 16Mbit SDRAM for temporary storage and a Flash memory of the same size for storing the bitstream. It features 8 output ports of a known pinout (HUB75) and 5V outputs. The board has caught attention of hardware hackers and soon after was fully reverse engineered by q3k and others. A schematic with pinouts is available, as well as other documentation. A great amount of work has been done here and this is what enables the Colorlight board to be used in the hacker spirit way.\nAccidentally, this board design happens to be a great compromise between feature-rich and IO-rich. The only on-board peripherals are the basic or high speed ones, which would be hard to connect over the 0.1\u0026quot; pin headers. It is also the only development board with a dual Gigabit Ethernet interface in its price range. Since it\u0026rsquo;s just an FPGA, the 16MBit SDRAM should be enough for most applications, while being easy to implement a controller for.\nHacking the board With the on-board JTAG port, you just need to solder on a 4 pin header and you are ready to upload your own bitstreams to the ECP5 FPGA. This FPGA is fully supported by the Yosys toolchain, from the verilog compiler through place and route engine to the bitstream generator, and along with an open source JTAG adapter like the Bus Pirate (or anything else, really) it only takes a moment to send the bitstream down and see your code run. There is a great deal of user accessible IO broken out on the HUB75 headers.\nThe FPGA has a 25MHz clock directed to it, as well as one onboard LED and a button, which is plenty enough for a Verilog \u0026ldquo;Hello, world!\u0026rdquo; project - blinking the LED.\nThe only downside of this board is lack of inputs by default - You need to replace the 74HC245 output drivers with bidirectional level shifters. However there exists a pin compatible level shifter IC, SN74CBT3245A which can replace the default output driver providing 3v3 bidirectional IO. Other options, such as fabricating tiny PCBs that replace the shifters with wires, or connecting the direction pin of the output drivers to an IO pin are also a possibility.\nSummary The Colorlight 5A-75B is a good choice for those who want to try open-source FPGA programming but do not wish to spend a significant amount of money for a classic development board. The on-board peripherals are enough for a first project to get acquainted with the toolchain. Gigabit Ethernet and SDRAM could also come in handy in future more advanced projects.\nIn the next post I will describe how to write, compile and upload a Verilog project that will blink the onboard led of the 5A-75B board.\nAbout the author Chris \u0026ldquo;polprog\u0026rdquo; Lasocki (@polprogpl) is a long time electronics hacker and an aspiring physicist.

Sby integrates these tools as engines and provides a unified interface. Additionally, many of the verification tools internally use lower-level tools like SAT and SMT solvers and allow the user to select between different supported solvers.\nMost verification tasks can be performed by several of the supported engines and solvers. Depending on the specific verification task at hand, there can be large performance differences between them. Thus, it makes sense to try several engines and solvers to pick the best performing one.\nWith Sby, switching the engine or solver only requires changing a single line in the “[engines]” section of the .sby file. Still, the large number of engine and solver configurations made it impractical to manually try all of them for every verification task, so it was easy to leave performance on the table by sticking with a worse performing configuration.\nTo help you get the best performance out of Sby, we now introduced the \u0026ndash;autotune option. If you add this option to your usual Sby invocation, it will go ahead and automatically try all recommended engine and solver combinations, producing a report that lists the best performing configurations. You can then copy a configuration from this report into your .sby file to use a faster engine for future sby invocations. From time to time, when updating the CAD suite, or making significant changes to your design, you can run autotune again to see if you are still using the best performing engine.\nSby \u0026ndash;autotune is also a lot smarter than just trying every configuration in sequence. It runs in parallel and knows how to use timeouts and retries so that a single slow engine that would take hours doesn’t keep Sby from quickly discovering a better configuration that finishes in seconds. When selecting the recommended engines and solvers, it also takes into account the design and settings in your .sby file to avoid known incompatibilities or performance issues.\nMore details on how to use and configure the automatic engine selection can be found in the corresponding section of the Sby documentation. If you want to try out the new autotune feature yourself, but don’t have a suitable Sby project at hand, you can try it on the small example project we prepared.\nAs always, we\u0026rsquo;re interested to hear how you get on with our tools\n","date":"2022-07-27T14:41:35+02:00","image":"http://blog.yosyshq.com/static-2022/autotune.png","permalink":"http://blog.yosyshq.com/p/sby-autotune/","title":"Autotune"},{"content":"The July release of Tabby CAD Suite is now available for download.\nSBY An autotune function!

A tristate output is one that can either drive the connected wire to a high or low logic level or be in a high impedance state where it does not drive the output. This allows directly connecting multiple tristate outputs as long as no two are driving the output simultaneously. With tribuf (tristate buffer) support turned on, sby will automatically create assertions for any tristate signals that can be driven via multiples outputs. If more than one tristate output can drive the same wire, such an assertion will fail. For example:\nmodule module1 (input wire active, output wire tri_out); assign tri_out = active ? 1'b0 : 1'bz; endmodule module module2 (input wire active, output wire tri_out); assign tri_out = active ? 1'b0 : 1'bz; endmodule module top_fail (input wire clk, input wire active1, input wire active2, output wire out); module1 module1 (.active(active1), .tri_out(out)); module2 module2 (.active(active2), .tri_out(out)); endmodule And an .sby file with a script section that includes:\nprep -top top_fail flatten; tribuf -formal Will fail with a message like:\nAssert failed in top: tristates.v:3 ($tribuf_conflict$$flatten/module1.$verific$i6$tristates.v:3$9) By ensuring that only one tristate module is active at once, for example\nmodule top_pass (input wire clk, input wire active1, output wire out); module1 module1 (.active(active1), .tri_out(out)); module2 module2 (.active(!active1), .tri_out(out)); endmodule Sby will now finish with no errors. There is no need to add any assertion to the design, with the tribuf -formal command enabled in the [script] section of the sby file, the assertions are added automatically. Note that the flatten command is required when any module outputs can be tristate and that it has to precede the tribuf -formal command.\nYou can try the example out here: https://github.com/YosysHQ/sby/tree/master/docs/examples/tristate The sby file makes use of 2 different task sections.\nI recently used this feature to prove the safety of the tristate bus for an ASIC design. The ASIC combines 13 smaller projects with 45 verilog files. Sby completes a full proof with a depth of 5 clock cycles in 10 seconds. You can take a look at the project\u0026rsquo;s repository and the .sby file.\nThis shows that verifying meaningful properties of a larger design doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to take hours or even days. The time required to prove a property is not set by the overall design complexity. State of the art solvers are very good at cutting through a ton of logic to identify just the relevant parts. In solver terminology this is called an unsatisfiable core and on the hardware side this corresponds to a subcircuit that alone ensures that a property holds. That means you could change everything that is not part of this core circuit and the property would still hold. The complexity of this subcircuit is a much better indicator of the required solver effort.\nIf you are familiar with the cone of influence concept, where you find the relevant logic by following the circuit\u0026rsquo;s structure, this might sound familiar. An important difference is that solvers do not only consider the structure but also the behavior implemented by a circuit, which is more precise. Thus for the same property, an unsatisfiable core circuit can be much smaller than the cone of influence.\nFor selecting between different projects within a single ASIC design, most of the projects\u0026rsquo; logic is not part of the unsatisfiable core. Only the logic responsible for selecting which tristate outputs are active together with the automatically added conflict checks needs to be considered. This is great because for medium to large projects with many source files, the solver can still provide an answer very quickly.\nIf you have experience with proving simple properties in large designs please let us know - we’re always interested in how people are using our tools.\n","date":"2022-06-17T17:28:17+02:00","image":"http://blog.yosyshq.com/static-2022/tristate.png","permalink":"http://blog.yosyshq.com/p/formal-trisate-support/","title":"Formal Tristate Support"},{"content":"The June release of Tabby CAD Suite is now available for download.\nYosys A big overhaul of memory inference in Yosys.

However, we consider this a problematic feature in a (System-)Verilog synthesis tool, and thus I’d like to take this opportunity to explain why one should avoid using asynchronous load flip-flops in new (System-)Verilog designs.\nWhat are asynchronous load flip-flops An asynchronous load flip-flop is a type of flip-flop with asynchronous reset for which the reset value is not a compile-time / synthesis-time constant.\nreg async_load_ff_q; wire async_load_ff_reset_val = \u0026lt;dynamic_expression\u0026gt;; always_ff @(posedge clock, posedge load) if (load) async_load_ff_q \u0026lt;= async_load_ff_reset_val; else async_load_ff_q \u0026lt;= ...; This distinguishes them from the more common asynchronous set (reset) flip-flops, for which the reset value is a compile-time (synthesis-time) constant.\nreg async_reset_ff_q; localparam async_reset_ff_reset_val = \u0026lt;constant_expression\u0026gt;; always_ff @(posedge clock, posedge reset) if (reset) async_reset_ff_q \u0026lt;= async_reset_ff_reset_val; else async_reset_ff_q \u0026lt;= ...; IEEE Std 1364.1-2002, the IEEE Standard for Verilog Register Transfer Level Synthesis, does allow such asynchronous load flip-flops in synthesis, but states that the synthesis results will only match the behavior of the original Verilog code under certain conditions.\nThe problem with Verilog and asynchronous load flip-flops The key insight is that the way an asynchronous reset is modelled using Verilog always blocks is not sensitive to the data signals providing the asynchronous load value. Thus, if the data signals are changing while the asynchronous reset is active, the new data is not loaded into the flip-flop when neither clock nor the asynchronous reset is toggling.\nConsider the following SystemVerilog design (dut.sv):\nmodule dut ( input clk1, clk2, arst, output reg [7:0] cnt1, cnt2 ); always_ff @(posedge clk1 or posedge arst) if (arst) cnt1 \u0026lt;= 0; // constant expression (async reset) else cnt1 \u0026lt;= cnt1 + 7; always_ff @(posedge clk2 or posedge arst) if (arst) cnt2 \u0026lt;= cnt1; // dynamic expression (async load) else cnt2 \u0026lt;= cnt2 + 11; endmodule And the following test bench (tb.sv):\nmodule tb; reg clk1 = 0, clk2 = 0, arst = 0; wire [7:0] cnt1, cnt2; dut dut (clk1, clk2, arst, cnt1, cnt2); task do_clk1; clk1 = 1; #5; clk1 = 0; #5; endtask task do_clk2; clk2 = 1; #5; clk2 = 0; #5; endtask task do_arst; arst = 1; #5; arst = 0; #5; `ifdef DOUBLE_ARST arst = 1; #5; arst = 0; #5; `endif endtask initial begin #10; do_arst; $display(cnt1, cnt2); repeat (5) do_clk1; $display(cnt1, cnt2); do_arst; $display(cnt1, cnt2, \u0026#34; \u0026lt;--\u0026#34;); repeat (5) do_clk2; $display(cnt1, cnt2); do_arst; $display(cnt1, cnt2); end endmodule Running it without and with -DDOUBLE_ARST produces the following output:\n$ make run0 iverilog -g2012 -o sim0 -s tb tb.sv dut.sv ./sim0 0 x 35 x 0 35 \u0026lt;-- 0 90 0 0 $ make run1 iverilog -g2012 -o sim1 -s tb -DDOUBLE_ARST tb.sv dut.sv ./sim1 0 0 35 0 0 0 \u0026lt;-- 0 55 0 0 In the first case with a single pulse on arst, the second counter is reset to the non-zero value of the first counter from before the reset pulse.\nBut a real-world asynchronous load flip-flop would of course behave like a transparent latch while the reset pulse is high, propagating the new (zero) value of the first counter to the second counter register. But this only happens in simulation when we pulse the reset signal a second time.\nThis can lead to non-trivial simulation-synthesis mismatches that are hard to debug, and may result in a chip that does not function as expected.\nThus, asynchronous load flip-flops should be avoided in (System)Verilog designs, or at least it should be formally verified that the asynchronous load value of such a flip-flop can never change while the reset signal is active.\nThis is in line with IEEE Std 1364.1-2002 requirements for sequential logic verification:\nWhen asynchronous data is assigned, the asynchronous data shall not change during the period in which the asynchronous control (the condition under which the data is assigned) is active.\nIEEE Std 1364.1-2002, Section 4.2\nIt is worth noting that a similar problem exists with flip-flops that have both asynchronous set and reset: If both are asserted and then one is released after the other, the one that’s released later should take precedence over the one that’s released earlier. However, since the always block is not triggered by the falling edge of the set or reset signal, releasing just one of the two will have no effect on the flip-flop output. IEEE Std 1364.1-2002 also acknowledges this issue:\nThe problem occurs when both reset and preset are asserted at the same time and reset is removed first. When reset is removed (posedge rst_n), the always block is not activated. This means that the output will continue to drive the reset output to ‘0’ until the next rising clock edge. A real flip-flop of this type would immediately drive the output to ‘1’ because the set_n signal is an asynchronous preset. This potentially could cause a mismatch between pre-synthesis and post-synthesis simulations using this model.\nIEEE Std 1364.1-2002, Appendix B.6\nPart 2: The Good News In this section we discuss different design methods that avoid the use of behavioral Verilog code to model asynchronous load FFs.\nInstantiate (Vendor) Primitives The best and easiest way of dealing with this issue is to instantiate FF primitives directly. This can either be vendor cells, or a user-defined module for which we chose different implementations for simulation and synthesis, one with correct simulation behavior, and one that is synthesizable, respectively.\nThe new DUT would look something like this (dut_myff.sv):\nmodule dut ( input clk1, clk2, arst, output reg [7:0] cnt1, cnt2 ); myff ff1[7:0] (cnt1, cnt1 + 8\u0026#39;d 7, clk1, arst, 8\u0026#39;h 00), ff2[7:0] (cnt2, cnt2 + 8\u0026#39;d 11, clk2, arst, cnt1); endmodule When instantiating a Vendor primitive one should always double-check that the vendor simulation library does model asynchronous loads correctly, for example using the techniques described in the next two sections.\nSimulation model using Verilog UDP Verilog UDP primitives can be used to correctly model the behavior of asynchronous load flip-flops. But UDPs are not synthesizable, so we need to also provide a synthesizable implementation of an asynchronous load flip-flop (myff_udp.sv):\n`ifdef SYNTHESIS module myff ( output reg q, input d, clk, arst, rval ); always @(posedge clk or posedge arst) if (arst) q \u0026lt;= rval; else q \u0026lt;= d; endmodule `else primitive myff (q, d, clk, arst, rval); input d, clk, arst, rval; reg q; output q; table // D C R V : Q : Q\u0026#39; ? ? 1 0 : ? : 0 ; // async reset ? ? 1 1 : ? : 1 ; // async set 0 p 0 ? : ? : 0 ; // posedge clock, d=0 1 p 0 ? : ? : 1 ; // posedge clock, d=1 ? n 0 ? : ? : - ; // negedge clock * ? ? ? : ? : - ; // any data edge ? ? * ? : ? : - ; // any arst edge ? ? ? * : ? : - ; // any rval edge endtable endprimitive `endif Running our test-bench now yields the expected result, even when we pulse the asynchronous load signal only once:\n$ make run2 iverilog -g2012 -o sim2 -s tb tb.sv dut_myff.sv myff_udp.sv ./sim2 0 0 35 0 0 0 \u0026lt;-- 0 55 0 0 Simulation model using procedural assign and deassign Another approach is to “fix up” the asynchronous load using procedural assign and deassign (myff_ada.sv):\nmodule myff ( output reg q, input d, clk, arst, rval ); always_ff @(posedge clk or posedge arst) if (arst) q \u0026lt;= rval; else q \u0026lt;= d; `ifndef SYNTHESIS always @(arst) if (arst) assign q = rval; else deassign q; `endif endmodule Running our test-bench on this version also yields the expected result:\niverilog -g2012 -o sim3 -s tb tb.sv dut_myff.sv myff_ada.sv ./sim3 0 0 35 0 0 0 \u0026lt;-- 0 55 0 0 Of course it’s also possible to use procedural assign and deassign directly in the design to “fix up” the behavior of asynchronous load flip-flops (dut_ada.sv):\nmodule dut ( input clk1, clk2, arst, output reg [7:0] cnt1, cnt2 ); always_ff @(posedge clk1 or posedge arst) if (arst) cnt1 \u0026lt;= 0; else cnt1 \u0026lt;= cnt1 + 7; always_ff @(posedge clk2 or posedge arst) if (arst) cnt2 \u0026lt;= cnt1; else cnt2 \u0026lt;= cnt2 + 11; `ifndef SYNTHESIS always @(arst) if (arst) assign cnt2 = cnt1; else deassign cnt2; `endif endmodule However, sprinkling procedural assign and deassign statements and ifndef-SYNTHESIS-blocks all over the design is much more error prone than implementing this work-around only once in a custom cell type that can then be instantiated wherever needed.\nThe latch+flip-flop trick The following technique is used on some FPGA architectures to emulate asynchronous-load flip-flops using latches and asynchronous-reset flip-flops only. It can be used to completely avoid asynchronous-load FFs while preserving the semantic of such elements (myff_hack.sv):\nmodule myff ( output q, input d, clk, arst, rval ); // a latch to store the async-load value reg latched_rval; always @* if (arst) latched_rval = rval; // a regular FF to store the clocked data value reg q_without_reset; always @(posedge clk) q_without_reset \u0026lt;= d; // an asynchronous-reset flip-flop to remember last event reg last_event_was_clock; always @(posedge clk or posedge arst) if (arst) last_event_was_clock \u0026lt;= 0; else last_event_was_clock \u0026lt;= 1; // output either the latched reset value or clocked data value assign q = last_event_was_clock ? q_without_reset : latched_rval; endmodule Running our test-bench a last time gives the expected result for this solution as well:\niverilog -g2012 -o sim5 -s tb tb.sv dut_myff.sv myff_hack.sv ./sim5 0 0 35 0 0 0 \u0026lt;-- 0 55 0 0 This is a useful last resort solution for designs that absolutely require asynchronous-load flip-flop semantics, and where the risks associated with using different synthesis and simulation models for such a component are not acceptable.\n","date":"2021-11-30T00:00:00Z","image":"http://blog.yosyshq.com/static-2021/asyncff.png","permalink":"http://blog.yosyshq.com/p/async-load-ff/","title":"Why Asynchronous Load Flip-Flops Should Be Avoided"},{"content":"YosysHQ are pleased to announce a new pricing option for small companies with one full time engineer.\nFor just €500 per month (excl.
