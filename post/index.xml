      <description>Subject: Tabby CAD Suite version 20230104 released!
The January release of Tabby CAD Suite is now available for download. With the holidays there have been only a few changes, of note:
SBY output is now in color. In other YosysHQ news: We have reformatted our service table to clarify some points we&amp;rsquo;ve seen cause confusion. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry, our prices remain the same as they&amp;rsquo;ve always been! Our first community spotlight article is about Tbengy, which is a Python Tool for SV/UVM Testbench Generation and RTL Synthesis.</description>

      <description>The December release of Tabby CAD Suite is now available for download. Notable changes in this version include:
We have improved support for SystemVerilog config elements. You can now have multiple configurations defined, and select which configuration to elaborate with verific -import &amp;lt;configname&amp;gt;. We are working on improving the TCL integration in Yosys. There is now an interactive TCL shell mode: use yosys -C to enter the TCL shell. You can now also use the following command to get the output of a command returned to TCL without the use of an intermediate file: set command_output [yosys tee -s result.</description>

      <title>Logic Primitive Transformations with Yosys Techmap</title>
      <link>http://blog.yosyshq.com/p/logic-primitive-transformations-with-yosys-techmap/</link>

      <description>This guest post is by Tom Verbeure.
Introduction If you&amp;rsquo;re reading this you probably already know that Yosys is an open source logic synthesis tool. You may also know that it&amp;rsquo;s much more than that: in my earlier blog post about CXXRTL I call it the swiss army knife of digital logic manipulation.
In most cases, using Yosys means running pre-made scripts that contain Yosys commands: when I&amp;rsquo;m synthesizing RTL for an FPGA of the Lattice iCE40 family, the synth_ice40 command is usually sufficient to convert my RTL into a netlist that can be sent straight to nextpnr for place, route, and bitstream creation.</description>

      <description>The November release of Tabby CAD Suite is now available for download. Notable changes in this version include:
We have experimentally added support for EDIF and Liberty verific parsers. They can be used either with the verific [-liberty|-edif] or the read [-liberty|-edif] command. We are evaluating whether it is of interest for us to keep these long-term, so please let us know if you use them and what your experience is!</description>

      <description>The October release of Tabby CAD Suite is now available for download.
The read and verific commands now support here-documents in scripts, the same way as read_verilog. This is useful e.g. to have small self-contained tests in a single file such as:
read -sv &amp;lt;&amp;lt;EOT module top(input clk, output reg [1:0] q); wire [1:0] x = 2&#39;b10; always @(posedge clk) q &amp;lt;= x &amp;amp; 2&#39;b11; endmodule EOT prep -top top sim -clock clk -n 1 -w top select -assert-count 1 a:init=2&#39;b10 top/q %i </description>

      <title>Introducing the Colorlight 5A-75B board</title>
      <link>http://blog.yosyshq.com/p/colorlight-part-1/</link>

      <description>This guest post is the first in a two part series by Chris Lasocki.
It seems that it was an accident - a generic part of a LED display has become a low cost FPGA development board. The board in question is the Colorlight 5A-75B, which is a so-called receiver card. Featuring a Lattice ECP5 FPGA, supported by Yosys, it allows you to leverage a fully open-source FPGA development toolchain. Priced on average at 20-25 USD, it is a very accessible board.</description>

      <description>The September release of Tabby CAD Suite is now available for download.
SBY SBY now runs multiple tasks in parallel. Additionally it now limits the number of concurrently running subprocesses to the available number of cores. The &amp;ndash;sequential command line option allows you to opt out of running tasks in parallel and the -j N option sets the limit of concurrent subprocesses to N instead of the default. All this is optionally integrated with the make jobserver protocol to enforce the concurrent process limit across other processes launched by make.</description>

      <description>The August release of Tabby CAD Suite is now available for download.
SBY SBY now uses a more precise logic loop analysis, removing the need to run simplemap on coarse-grain cells that re-use parts of a signal. In other YosysHQ news Since we introduced the new autotune option, we’ve now written up a blogpost with an example on how to get started. </description>

      <description>Sby, our frontend for formal verification, makes it easy to use Yosys with the various open source verification tools that are included in our CAD suites. Sby integrates these tools as engines and provides a unified interface. Additionally, many of the verification tools internally use lower-level tools like SAT and SMT solvers and allow the user to select between different supported solvers.
Most verification tasks can be performed by several of the supported engines and solvers.</description>

      <description>The July release of Tabby CAD Suite is now available for download.
SBY An autotune function! This won’t fix your singing, but we hope it will help you to choose a good solver for your application. Please check the new documentation here to get started. Please let us know if you try the new feature. We will write a blogpost about it for the next newsletter. In other YosysHQ news Since tribuf support was added in May, we wrote a short blogpost about Matt’s use of it for his latest ASIC submission.</description>

      <title>Formal Tristate Support</title>
      <link>http://blog.yosyshq.com/p/formal-trisate-support/</link>

      <guid>http://blog.yosyshq.com/p/formal-trisate-support/</guid>
      <description>Sby, our formal verification tool has recently got better support for tristate circuits. A tristate output is one that can either drive the connected wire to a high or low logic level or be in a high impedance state where it does not drive the output. This allows directly connecting multiple tristate outputs as long as no two are driving the output simultaneously. With tribuf (tristate buffer) support turned on, sby will automatically create assertions for any tristate signals that can be driven via multiples outputs.</description>

      <description>The June release of Tabby CAD Suite is now available for download.
Yosys A big overhaul of memory inference in Yosys. The new pass memory_libmap supports a wider variety of memory patterns, such as single-port memories or asymmetric memories. It will also strictly respect verilog semantics in cases of address collision, adding emulation circuitry to ensure the synthesized behavior matches simulation. To omit the emulation circuitry even in cases where it is required for correctness, you can add the (* no_rw_check *) attribute to the array declaration of the memory.</description>

      <description>The May release of Tabby CAD Suite is now available for download.
SBY The tribuf pass now supports a -formal option that converts inferred tri-state buffers within a module into equivalent non-tri-state logic for formal verification. It automatically adds assertions that detect multiple drivers driving the same net simultaneously. (When using tri-state I/O across modules, tribuf -formal should be preceded by a flatten pass). Several changes in the handling of x values during formal verification.</description>

      <description>The April release of Tabby CAD Suite is now available for download.
Yosys The sim command now allows co-simulation with stimulus values from aiger and btor2 witness files as well as traces in VCD or FST format. Co-simulation of designs with multiple clock domains was improved. SBY The --keep-going option was added to the smtbmc engine. With this option, the solver will continue to check the remaining properties even after an assertion fails.</description>

      <description>Yosys is probably best known for providing synthesis for FPGA targets, but it&amp;rsquo;s a very flexible tool capable of a lot more.
OpenLane, SiliconCompiler and Coriolis2 are 3 examples of open source ASIC flows, which has been an active field of development over the last year.
We&amp;rsquo;re very happy to see our tools get used in the first Google sponsored tapeouts, helping to make the world&amp;rsquo;s first chips made with an open source PDK, and open source all the way down to the designs.</description>

      <title>Why Asynchronous Load Flip-Flops Should Be Avoided</title>
      <link>http://blog.yosyshq.com/p/async-load-ff/</link>

      <description>Code: https://github.com/YosysHQ-Docs/Blog-Async-Load-FFs
Part 1: The Bad News We have recently added support for asynchronous load flip-flops to Yosys for a customer project. However, we consider this a problematic feature in a (System-)Verilog synthesis tool, and thus I’d like to take this opportunity to explain why one should avoid using asynchronous load flip-flops in new (System-)Verilog designs.
What are asynchronous load flip-flops An asynchronous load flip-flop is a type of flip-flop with asynchronous reset for which the reset value is not a compile-time / synthesis-time constant.</description>
